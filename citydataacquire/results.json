New York is celebrated for its wealth of nationalities, ethnicities and languages. But why would anyone want to live in NYC? It's insanely expensive, there are too many crazy people, it's bundles of energy and famously, \"If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere.\" And lots of people love the challenge! Most important, it’s the city that exemplifies American pluralism, the “melting pot” that attracts new immigrants looking for work and college graduates drawn from their hometowns by the promise of excitement and opportunity. Its appeal hangs on its image as a city where everyone can try, get, and be anything. It has been my home for more than 40 years and I love it for its social and economic freedoms. My education and computer technology background fit right in and I found great career and social successes.",

If you're an on the go kind of person, the city is the place for you! However, there are definitely downfalls about living there. For one, everything is HARDER living in such an urban environment. Getting places, grocery shopping, regular household stuff such as doing laundry (if you're building doesn't have a laundry machine), maintenance issues, etc. It's also crazy expensive. But honestly, where I'm at in my life right now, I wouldn't trade living there for the world.",

What I definitely like about this city is the amount of opportunities and lack of scarcity of anything. There is almost an abundance of everything you can imagine! As I grew older I began to relize that the main thing I do not like or appreciate about this city, is the cost of living. This ties into businesses, businesses owners, company executives, because a lot of the higher ranked individuals who want to make more money, make it harder each year for individuals like myself who try to make way for themseleves for a better life. I see a lot of people using other people to their advantages in order to gain some benefit from one another. I do not like the fact that it is such a steep and treacherous uphill battle for individuals who were not born with a lot and who have to really battle for their path of life.

If I could change any one thing about LA, it would be the addition of viable and comprehensive public transit - it really pales in comparison to other cities of a similar size, like New York City or London. Another thing to consider is the weather. Most people love LA for its mild climate. Personally, I'm a fan of changing weather and seasons - having grown up in the midwest, it's something that I really miss about home. So if you like a variety from day to day (and also like to wear a variety of outfits), then Los Angeles may not be the place for you. However, even for someone like me who really hates the never-changing weather, there are still so many opportunities here - from jobs to recreation - that the cons are widely outshone by the pros.",

You can find any ethnic town you could think of; from Chinatown to Olvera street, Thai Town and Little Armenia, you will be encompassed by the culture and don't even get me started on the amazing authentic food! Nothing beats the diversity that comes with Los Angeles. Aside from this there is so much opportunity here. Born and raised in Sacramento, I didn't know how interesting life could really be. Dreams do come true in Los Angeles as long as you have the right attitude. As with everything else though, there are some major problems here. The homeless community in LA is the hardest part. Skid Row is notoriously known for it's homeless community, the area's hardship's date back to the 1880's. If I could help to change one thing about LA, it would be this.",

Sometimes, it's hard to see both the wealth of certain people and the dying one in the street. As an International student, it's hard to cope with such a gap. I was told it was inevitable to have a car in LA, I personally think it's not true. I've been using public transportation since I've arrived and I'm pretty much satisfied with it!

There are hundreds of things to do. For example, if you want to do touristy activities, you can go to the bean, Grant Park, John Hancock Center, and Navy Pier. However, if you want a more local experience, you can go to Millennium Park and watch a movie outdoors with the rest of the city, go to Chinatown and explore different Chinese dishes, visit Little Village and get an authentic Mexican American experience. People tend to be generally kind and respectful to one another. The city is among one of the cleanest in the United States! We have one of the best public transportation systems and one of the largest public school systems in the United States. Additionally, there are four distinct seasons that each offer unique experiences.",

The CTA, our public transit system, and the city's bike-friendliness have allowed me to happily, easily live here without a car. The winter's are tough, but the summers are worth it!",

My experience with Chicago has been both good and bad. There is a lot of violence and injustice that comes with living here. I love the beautiful view and skyline. I love The Bean and Navy Pier. Chicago is indeed ready for a change. I feel as though everyone as a whole and community should come together to support each other and have a positive attitude.You can go to the lakefront. Chicago has Lake Michigan with it’s numerous beaches and parks. Chicago is unique and diverse. Chicago food is a must! Chicago is known for some of the best restaurants. The pizza is thick, the hot dogs are unmatched, and there's this food called Italian beef. Chicago has multiple places you can visit and cite see.  Overall, Chicago is indeed a loving place. We just have to progress and work towards change in some aspects. -Thank you!",

There is community, good food, affordability, and opportunity. Harris County and Fort Bend County are incredibly diverse. We have some amazing school districts down here. I like the weather because I enjoy summer weather. Out of our 5 major sports teams (NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS, and NWLS) - at least 1 is competing for a championship in any given year. \n\nHowever, there are drawbacks. Public transit does not really exist, and commuting in a car sucks. Our conservative state government is also making life harder for racial minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ people. Our suburbs reflect this thinking as well.\n\nI still believe this place a bright future!",

If you're looking to be healthy, you can easily go to the Brays Bayou which will take you around Downtown. Different places you can visit are, the Houston zoo, Downtown aquarium, and other museums. Though the diversity population is very high, another high population here are homeless people. As a Houstonian, we have to help our brothers and sister relocate to a better place. On the other hand, getting a job is really easy and its very affordable compared to other big cities.",

Houston also has the beach, which is about an hour drive, lakes that are about 30 minutes- 1hour drive, and camping parks that are about an 1 drive. One of the popular parks here is Memorial park, which you will see so many people from different backgrounds. Many families go to this park to have a picnic and bring their pets. Also, a beautiful pond has been added with walking trails. One of the popular places to go shopping at is the Galleria mall. It has so many stores, and is known for famous people shopping here sometimes. In the winter time, it's beautifully decorated for the holidays, and it has a skating rink! If you are into the night-life, visit Midtown or Washington avenue. There's also a lot of water parks nearby for families",

Though I feel I haven't been able to fully explore Arizona the way I'd like to, I've met people on every spectrum. I'm impressed with how diverse Arizona is, though there are a lot of improvements that could be made. I'm used to living in a community where I would step out and there would be  dozens of small businesses everywhere offering a variety of services. In comparison, Arizona is comprised of strip malls and chain restaurants. The night life is lacking unless you hit up Old Town by the ASU campus, which is a bit of a commute from where I live. Though everything seems to be 20+ minutes away from eachother, I feel the traffic here isn't as bad as Seattle's. You're at least moving rather than sitting bumper to bumper. I feel safe in my neighborhood though there was an incident where I was almost kidnapped, but I feel that could happen anywhere. I just wish it wasn't so hot all the time, I stay indoors!",

Over the years Phoenix has developed its own unique \"Phoenix\" culture.   This is apparent when you attend First Fridays, try a local business, or go to school.  The city is blessed with a diverse group of people with lofty dreams, and the passion to fulfill them.  The future is bright for Phoenix, and this is thanks to our hungry spirit of entrepreneurship, creativity, and inclusivity.  Opportunities in business, education, and a safe and welcoming environment for families to draw more people to move here than almost any other city in the country.",

Chestnut Hill and Rittenhouse square are quaint areas with little shops and markets. Manayunk is occupied with young residents and has bars, restaurants, and activities all year long. University city and North Philadelphia have numerous college students from all over the world who get together to not only excel in their careers, but to also grow up together. While the notorious South Street is filled with life, history, and it has a special ambiance to it. There’s something for everyone in Philadelphia! Whether it’s food, art, culture, history, education, entertainment, or sports, Philadelphia has it all. Even if you aren’t moving to Philadelphia, I recommend everyone to visit at least once in their lifetime, you won’t regret it!",

The people are as down to earth as they get! I love the city I was born and raised in. Unfortunately, Philadelphia also has a very large drug problem, especially opioids. I believe many of the addicts here (and everywhere) may also have mental illnesses. If there was one thing about this city I would change, it would be better and easier access to mental health services for people that need them. People say “it’s not my problem” but it IS, it’s EVERYONE’s problem.",

Center City Philadelphia is beautiful, and there is an abundance of activities(for all seasons), places to eat, and historical sights to see. The people is Philadelphia are very respectful and well mannered, but we usually like to keep to ourselves, and leave it at a simple \"Hello\" and \"See you later\". Philadelphia is a huge city with many different cultures, ethnicities, languages and in general is very diverse. The different cultures is Philadelphia are famously embraced and celebrated and there are even parts of the city specifically dedicated to bringing exposure and appreciation to the diversity in Philly. The food in Philadelphia is absolutely amazing, and our famous Philly Cheesesteaks can be found all around the city. And due to our immense diversity, all foods from most ethnic backgrounds are easily accessible. And transportation is great!",

The highways are unsafe, heavy items in the back of a truck like a ladder, without locking it down or using a tarp. Hemispheres park is nice but very little restrictions. San Antonio neighborhood are very dark during the evenings.  Also, the culture during Halloween is gross and not imaginative. There isn’t much to do unless your an adult or teenager. The public transit has improved. You can take a round trip Amtrak ride into downtown. This city has potential but don’t move here without knowing what some of the issues are. Also, this city is extremely religious. So by all means join a church and be prepared to live like your in “east LA”(that’s not a compliment). If you plan to live further out of SA it’s a lot better, you need good credit, a clean background check, a very good paying job!",

San Antonio has offerings for an array of likes and hobbies. You can enjoy the downtown life; day or night! There's so much to learn about the history and the culture of South Central Texans at any time of the year but my personal favorite is in April during Fiesta when the city comes together to celebrate the heroes of the Alamo and Battle of San Antonio. I highly recommend San Antonio as a place to visit or live based on the affordable realty, family centricity and great school systems.",

My family is originated from Spain and have since migrated to many parts of Mexico. I have hispanic background and the most amazing thing about San Antonio is the variety of Mexican food and especially the small business food trucks! There's nothing like walking downtowns riverwalk then going on a late night drive down to a local food truck. The workers are always busy but so grateful. The people you met are friendly and outgoing. The atmosphere of being able to get some good food and being able to sit at the tailgate of a truck and listen to tejano music at midnight is one of the greatest feelings to have.",

There are loads of activities to get into, many of them being outdoors. There is hiking, roller skating, walking the boardwalk at the beach, surfing, kayaking in the open ocean, walking around Balboa Park, going to the zoo, etc. I have felt safe throughout my time living here, and I have made many new friends. It is a small city and coincidentally, I run into the same people often! The commute to virtually any location in San Diego is 15-20 minutes or less! There are many job/career opportunities. I found and molded myself while living in San Diego, and I feel ready to take on what life has to throw at me. \n\nOverall, my time in this city and the state of California has been magical, and I do not plan on leaving anytime soon.",

If you're more of an outdoors person, San Diego is the perfect place to go to start your day hiking in the moutains or a trail, then go offroading in the desert, and surfing or enjoying the sun and the sand at the beach. San Diego also has so much culture, from its diverse populations, to its  mecca for diverse food, and as well as museums and events.

There are endless coffee shops and restaurants to try, as well as rich culture as it is a melting pot with Mexico as a next door border town!\nThe only change I'd like to see would be a bigger effort by our city to deal with the homeless issue, there has to be a better way to care for them and give them the proper attention and help they need.",

You need to have a car here, because public transportation is unreliable and uncommon for the most part. I live in the downtown area, which makes it easy for me to enjoy walks or avoid public transportation. In uptown, the restaurants are somewhat bougie and have a beautiful interior. The food doesn’t match the service and interior of the restaurant most of the time. While the food isn’t bad, I wouldn’t say that it was shockingly good. The job opportunity here are great, though. Overall, Dallas is a nice place to save up money and enjoy good weather.",

It is currently in a boom of new residents, which is great, but the downside is there is currently construction of new buildings and road/other beautification from the city. The DART public transit system is affordable and easy to use. It lets you travel all over the city and all the way to Denton!",

We have food from all over the world. Outside of New York, you will not find a more diverse community. It is a beautiful thing to see. San Jose has a pretty chill vibe. It doesn't feel as hustle bustle as the city does even with a higher population. That being said... apartments are going up EVERYWHERE! You will run into construction pretty much everywhere. There are a ton of cars on the road, but not the best drivers. Stay vigilant, people jump multiple lanes constantly. There is a great artist base in San Jose. We have plenty of museums and attractions to checkout (when the world isn't on lockdown). If you enjoy being outside there are a ton of parks to check out. The hiking trails are pretty neat too! Alum Rock Park is always gorgeous. In summary, maybe just visit.",

The San Jose area has so many things to do, you'll never run out. However, the housing prices are ridiculous and the Downtown area is really dirty, slightly eerie as there's some crime down there. Nevertheless, it feels like a nice neighborhood that's pretty average on the US scale, but more fun! San jose is known for is known for its unbeatable weather, incredible hiking trails, and safe suburban neighborhoods.  looking for something to do?

Part of why I chose Austin is that I believed it to be a fun, creative city--\"Keep Austin Weird.\" But it's weird is 10% of what I'd see on a Tuesday at 10am in LA. That may be appealing to some, but I loved the absurdity of every day life. Austin is pretty vanilla with terrible infrastructure. The power grid seems to be held together by decaying Twizzlers. And boil water notices? I've lived through earthquakes & wildfires...never experienced it. Also, they say winter is mild but it is on par with NYC in terms of temperature. I kind of feel like I've traveled back in time to the 90's. The patriarchy rules and entertainment focuses on drinking and meat drowned in sauces. I'm saving money on rent, but it's not worth losing so much culture, fun, great food and innovative creativity. In this context, it's ridiculously expensive for what it is. Traffic is much better than LA though!",

Students, single professionals, military service people and especially families. The cost of living is great reasonable. Schools are great. There are many different neighborhoods so it accommodates every lifestyle. It is easily accessible via interstate 95 and our great airport! It blends the perfect mix of lowcountry meets the tropics. There is a mild change of seasons which is rare for Florida. It’s  a kept secret not everyone knows about or appreciates.",

It has many scenic nature trails, rivers, and a beach. There are many outdoor and indoor activities to keep you entertained no matter your age! I enjoyed the overcrowded schools I attended before college. I was able to experience the diversity of the city at a very young age.  Jacksonville is safe place to live. It has became expensive to live. The market is very competitive if you are looking to purchase a home. You can expect just about everything in Jacksonville a city has to offer.",

Not to mention, there are schools all around, and the environment is family-friendly for any newcomers thinking about living in Fort Worth. From my perspective, the affordability for new houses or apartments is fair, and food can be provided anywhere. Last but not least, safety is ensured, and a wide variety of diversity is included for those who feel uncomfortable with their surroundings. Thus, Fort Worth is an incredible area for one to live in since they provide safety and comfortability for any classes.",

There are lots of opportunities to meet new people and explore exciting places. Almost anyone can find something they enjoy here to do. The activities are numerous. For example, they have multiple music halls to suit everyone's tastes. The Newport is great for alternative and up-and-coming artists and the Schottenstein Center houses tons of big artists. In addition to entertainment, there are lots of parks for being in an urban environment.  This is great for people with dogs or people who just need a break from the hectic feel of city life. I would highly recommend this area for people with families as well. There are growing suburban areas surrounding Columbus that have great schools and shops of their own to explore. Once I am done with college, I may set up a permanent home in Columbus myself because the environment is unmatched.",

It's just a few minutes drive to the nearest store so that cuts back on drive time and leaves more time to do other things. Parts of Columbus are bad, but the majority of it is safe. The pandemic has unfortunately shut a lot of activities down, but normally Columbus has something every weekend in the summer from Renaissance festival to coffee trails. There are a lot of parks around in several different parts of town so that makes it convenient for a family to have a free day of fun. One of my favorite stores is Ohio Thrift and Columbus has several of them. I was able to find a lot of work clothes and some toys for my nephews. There are also several stores like Home Buys that offers wholesale prices. Sometimes I can find really good deals.",

Prior to moving back, I had been living on the west coast where buying a home would have been impossible for me. The people in the midwest are friendly and welcoming. I know my neighbors! We spend time together. The population is diverse. There are great sporting events. Not only do the Pacers make their home here; but also race fans pour end every summer for the Indy 500. Indianapolis has its own Symphony Orchestra, an Art Museum, a Children's Museum, and lots of great places to eat. Indianapolis has become much more dangerous over the years, however. In 2018, it was considered the 10th most dangerous city in the country based on the number on violent crimes. Indiana is a conservative state; however, Indy is reasonably forward thinking and accepting of alternative lifestyles.",

I would highly recommend it to anyone young, old, families, couples who want a quiet affordable city to live in.",

I have met many from Latin America, a few from Europe many middle easterner. There are so many Asian which I did not expect to have settle in the Midwest. Apparently, there is about 30,000 Burmese families. Which diversity of cultures, people are more understanding, appreciative and respectful of one's beliefs and culture. The not so good thing about Indianapolis , conflict do arise among the younger generate different races due to this diversity. There are also not many attraction in Indianapolis apart Indy 500, the Indianapolis Zoo, Holiday World, the river walk in downtown and miles upon miles of cornfield. We definitely need some more attractions.  On the plus side, the housing are cheap, compared to places like Nashville, Los Angeles or San Francisco. The traffics aren't the bad like the places I've mentioned. Welcome to Indianapolis!!!!",

We have something for everyone here from high-end shopping to theme parks or playing in a park to all major sports venues! With that does come the usual growing pains of a larger city: traffic, crime, and lots of construction. Charlotte is also divided up into neighborhoods. Most people stay in their areas but venture out for nightlife and dining. South End and NoDa are two blossoming areas that definitely have something to meet anyone's tastes. Overall, Charlotte is a beautiful city, placed between a rolling mountain range and the crystal blue waters of the Atlantic. It is a MUST VISIT!",

Everything in Charlotte is truly unique.",

But living in a city is a wonderful opportunity to check out new restaurants and bars. Charlotte has a huge brewery scene that definitely keeps people coming. The White Water Center is just about 20 minutes from uptown and a fantastic place to bring visiting friends and family. The exciting and fun stuff to do at the White Water Center include ropes course, white water rafting, kayaking, walking your dogs, zip lining, biking and so much more. It is a great place to have an outdoor adventure. Speaking of outdoor adventures - you can have so many of those here since the weather is beautiful about 10 months out of the year. Only in January and February does it get quite chilly, but you should never really see snow. It is probably one of the only things I really miss - the snow and the beach!",

I can't even count how many new and fresh things I can experience in this big city! The only issue that I have is that it can be a little smelly and dirty at times and the homeless people can be absolutely terrifying. But that's the balance of it, positive and the negative!",

I've always been relatively reserved and thus don't go out that often, but I've changed by habits quite a bit after moving here which may be due to the overall connected nature of the city. Nothing feels overly far off given how the streets diverge at so many points and thus I find myself going to more places than I did before (the variety of stores and public spaces also contributed to this). The overall atmosphere of the city can feel pretty dangerous in a good few places admittedly, but as long as you keep an eye out and stay cautious of your surroundings, you're good. Even though its only been about a month, my time in San Francisco has been a pretty positive one and I hope it continues to stay that way as my stay here continues!",

There are plenty of tech companies in the surrounding area (Seattle, Kirkland, Bellevue, Redmond), and the quality of life is generally very good. Unfortunately, the cost of living is quite high and increasing. Another good thing about Seattle is the many coffee shops—they are numerous and diverse. Lastly, the location is excellent. While Seattle offers plenty of city life, nature is just around the corner. We have beaches and mountains and forests all around. Good for swimming, hiking, skiing, climbing, etc.",

Also, something as simple as a neighborhood walk looking at people's impressive gardens. Then of course, the mountains! Hikes as close as 30 mins away. \n\nI also love the coffee shops! There is every kind of coffee shop here. You can go with a friend, or alone! \n\nFarmers markets! The Ballard and Fremont ones are my favorite. \n\nThe sense of community. Whatever your passion is, you can find your \"people\". Foodies, bikers, parents, gamers, dancers, bibliophiles....everyone! \n\nWe have mountains, beaches, rolling hills, water....a little bit of everything!",

Residing in Seattle, I get all the benefits of a big city (good food, entertainment, a variety of schools, public transportation, job opportunities, etc...) while maintaining easy access to the beautiful nature of Washington state. There are countless forests, mountains, volcanoes, lakes, waterfalls, parks, and rivers all in easy driving distance, and there's outdoor fun year round if you enjoy skiing, snowboarding, or the like. Although some complain about the weather, it really isn't as rainy as most people make it out to be. The winter occasionally yields snow, and the summer sees sunny days occasionally nearing even ninety degrees. Seattle is pretty diverse, but even though locals generally pride themselves for being liberal and progressive that isn't to say issues like racism, police brutality, or gentrification are non-existent here. Yet every place has its issues, and in Seattle the pros far outweigh the cons!",

Dog parks and regualr parks with easy access. Almost all the restaurants offer patio sitting where you and your furry friend can sit and enjoy the day. There are quite a few coffee shops and cute niche stores. The breweries are top notch and there are so many of them! I have yet to explore all that Denver has to offer. Almost every year I am here I find a new concert or event to go to. There is an art district as well, which is definitely something to check out. Adventurers come",

I wish the people could be nicer to one another.

The city is in the dead center of the state of Oklahoma and with that being said, the city offers a wide selection of places to eat, drink, and have fun.  Because the state is not densely inhabited, traffic is significantly better than in other states, especially during peak hours. For the capitol of the state, Oklahoma City is very clean and calm; a perfect place to stay for individuals not too worried about going out to excuisite places and such. Just as everything isn't perfect, so is Oklahoma City. The city does not offer any national monuments or anything where you would drive out of your state to see. The houses within the city are relatively old and simply do no not fit the modern day standard. Houses within cities such as Edmond and Norman are much better when compared to that of Oklahoma City.",

The city's size plays a factor in this, as bigger spaces offer more opportunities and resources.

While traffic can be difficult at times, once you are in an area it is generally easy to get around. West Nashville is also very accessible to and from all other neighborhoods.

Nashville is no doubt an \"it city\", with at one time close to 100 people moving here a day!  It's also Music City, and that's not just some silly nickname.  As a working musician who's played in different areas around the country, I can say with complete certainty that Nashville's music scene is unlike any other, with a very open arms approach to upcoming artists either local or transient.  Live music of all sorts every day of the week across all areas of the city at multiple top level venues.  This is Music City.  \n\nAside from the music and arts scene, this is also a city that prides itself on its many outdoors attractions.  Biking/walking trails throughout the city along with wonderful parks of all sizes are extremely welcoming as well as a great reprieve from the sometimes overbearing hustle and bustle of downtown.",

The city of El Paso has many qualities like being named one of the safest cities in the world, the culture and food, and the people. The people in El Paso are welcoming no matter who you are or where you come from they will always make you feel at home, also, they are respectful and loving. In August 3rd, 2019 El Paso had the deadliest shooting ever reported there. It was devastating because it was unexpected and they disturbed El Paso’s peace. This setback brought everyone together and became closer. It made us stronger. El Paso keeps growing every year more and more population wise and land wise. The Franklin Mountains, Scenic Drive and our sunsets are some of our best features! I love El Paso despite the really hot weather and the construction.",

There's always something to do here: lots of farmers markets, festivals, all the free museums and attractions, lots of open, free outdoor space. It is easy to stay away from the political bubble, as well, if you're not into that sort of thing. I keep up with the news, but am no way considered a wonk, so it's great to be in a bit of a bubble here and know that people care about many different causes and the state of the world without being overwhelmed. A lot of different non-profits and fields exist here, making it a great place to be professionally. Though it's expensive, the great happy hour + brunch + free activities make it worth it. It's also super diverse, which I love as someone from a Pakistani background!",

DC has been my favorite place to live out of all the others places which my family and i have been located. The reason for this being, is because of the culture and atmosphere. The culture and alive and proud along with the atmosphere being welcoming and euphoric. One thing which I wish to change about the city, is the presents of police. To many, the police are seen as awful and along with being intruding. However, I think this could change if the police make an appearance in community gatherings. This can be done my showing up at the local recreation center to play a game of basketball, running races, and willingness to be friendly and openminded.",

There are also a plethora of interesting restaurants, museums, etc. Before the pandemic, the city had many open attractions for tourists to enjoy. Public transportation is highly accessible with the D.C. Metro Train System. With the variety of train stations, tourists and residents can easily explore the Metropolitan area.\n\n Washington D.C. also has rich history. Aside from the numerous musicians, actors, etc. who originate from the area, the city is home to one of the highest acclaimed historically black universities: Howard University. Some notable\nalumni include: Phylicia Rashard(Actor), and current Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nHowever, the city can improve on cleanliness. Like many urban cities, there is a high volume of pollution and trash. There is often heavy traffic during rush hours. Even at night, the city can become quite noisy. Washington D.C. also has very strict parking rules, which are also heavily enforced.",

I also go to college here and there are so many other college students to meet with many different colleges around the area. With the city itself, it may be small but different neighborhoods are renovating and expanding. Especially with Seaport, there are many buildings in that area and different shops to check out if you want to buy something. The food is great too! I usually eat Asian food, so I go to Chinatown, Dorchester, and Quincy a lot and just eat. There are many great sightseeing locations too! I have a camera and like to take pictures. So some tips on where to go is Seaport, North Point Park, Charles River Esplanade, Quincy Quarry, Boston Common, Commonwealth Ave, Castle Island, etc.",

It has its problems, including rising housing costs, agonizingly slow destruction of systemic segregation, salty out-of-touch Boomers, nonsensical streets, and some rich jerks. But the perfect city doesn't exist.\n\nNowhere on Earth will you find a more vibrant, intelligent, innovative, young population driven to effect positive change every single day. It's an old, well-maintained city with young energy that today tilts more towards quirky than snobby. Boston's a major city that feels like a town. You trade the 2am nightlife for gorgeous, clean parks and neighborhoods, pristine cultural institutions, and the greatest sports experience on planet Earth. (You can still get real rowdy in Boston, too.)\n\nAmerica's a good country; all these metrics are relative and subjective. I grew up in Boston, left to broaden my horizons, and it took living all over the country (and some genuine change in the city) to realize it just doesn't beat New England.",

The only exception would be the very infrequent flash floods, but that's tolerable when compared to elsewhere.\n\n2) There is no state income tax! \n\n3) The Las Vegas Strip has an incredible dining and entertainment scene. Need I say more? Furthermore, there are plenty of dining and buffet options off-strip that are very affordable. \n\n4) The outdoor scenery at Red Rock Canyon (twenty minutes away from the center of town) is envious. There are seven national and state parks and near Las Vegas, including Death Valley, Grand Canyon, and Lake Mead!\n\n5) The traffic forecast is light compared to our neighbors in California. Furthermore, traveling across the state is easy!\n\nWith Las Vegas being an international destination, you'll always have someone to meet or something to do here!",

They are still building, and that's the thing about Las Vegas. This town is not necessarily based on realism, or cynicism. Builders, job seekers, dreamers, and escapists continue to flock to Las Vegas. Why? Well, along with New York City, London, etcetera, it is somewhere most everyone in the world has heard of. Unlike these other cities, it is not essential. It is not pessimistic. Many people here plunge every spare dime into those empty hopes and dreams. Schools are underfunded, and our taxes are too low for anyone's benefit. This town doesn't cater to \"losers\", such as the unemployed, victims of crime, people with addictions, or the disabled. there is no light rail, just a inconvenient monorail system on the strip. Our buses are a joke.  In a world of dreams, structure can be missing for many. So make of it what you can!",

I've had a pretty good experience with the public school system, and the private school. The education system could definitely improve but it hasn't been a bad experience at all. I do think the schools could be a lot safer, especially the high schools, there's definitely an issue with drugs amongst all public and private high schools, but nothing I've been personally affected by. Vegas is definitely diverse! It's also a pretty easy to commute to places, the only issue is that since it's a large city, there is pretty bad rush hour traffic. When it comes to job opportunities, there's plenty! Theres also plenty healthy living options.",

One of the things I have always and still continue to enjoy is the food diversity within the area. Whatever you are craving, you can find an authentic food truck or restaurant. There are many lovely hiking spots, long or short with in an hours drive, that you can take to escape the city. Many have spots you can stop and enjoy the water for a swim. Majority of the trails and food spots are dog friendly which make is nice for when you don't want to leave the pup at home by themselves.\nPortland is also a short distance from everything active. Want to go snowboarding? Mt. Hood is only an hour and a few minutes away. Feel like heading to the coast? Also, just over an hours drive. You also have the dunes for any sand toys you or friends have. If not, there are more than plenty of companies you can rent from to help make the experience better.In the city there are some unique tours you can take!",

There are always top-notch bands passing through, numerous cycling events  (for those two-wheeled adventurers),  outdoor movies galore in the warm summer months and hiking trails a plenty in Forest Park (a mere stone throw away).\n\nPortland pretty much has a little bit for anybody that doesn't mind some rain. Hey! and Portland usually has pretty mild winters. But if you must, Mt. Hood isn't too far east and it provides some fantastic skiing or Snowboarding.",

But even with all these positive things many things in this city needs to be change. For example, the gun violence's because it makes the city unsafe for the kids to be playing outside. Also the road conditions because when I be out driving you would see glass in the street and pot holes as big as Texas! Finally, if you feel like the gun violence and road conditions are not bad, their are many sex offenders in our city and I feel that that is a huge problem in our city!",

I also love that leaders of our community, through programs like the Detroit promise scholarships, sponsor kids with low financial backgrounds and high academic achievements. This gives me hope because I strongly believe that no child should be left out of attaining the education they desire simply because they can't pay for their college education. With that being said, I am grateful that I live in Detroit: A city in which leaders provide resources needed to push each child toward reaching the highest academic levels they wish to reach.",

There are so many people with different backgrounds, and living here has allowed me to learn so much about the importance of ones culture. There are so many fun things to do like drive along the river, go to parks, go out to eat, see movies, shop, go see the Louisville Bats Baseball games, visit Churchill Downs, and much more. It's also a great location geographically because it's close to many other big cities. Nashville and Indianapolis are both about 3-4 hours away, and most people who live here also make the drive down to Florida fairly easy. Our summers are long and hot, and our winters are unpredictable. Overall, Louisville is a very fun and unique city to live in, and I'm so glad I had the privilege to grow up in it.",

My experience is based on frequent outings to try new food locations, volunteering opportunities through my current occupation, and fairs plus festivals that continue to bind the community together. I have enjoyed living in Louisville after college because of the ambient atmosphere. Louisville never seems to be in a rush, the quality of conversation from individuals you may meet in a store, at a restaurant, or at basketball games never ceases to amaze me. Kind people are not hard to find here and I hope this enjoyment is finds any and everyone who takes to time to live in this area.",

Our historic Old Louisville area is moments from downtown and waterfront area. It is becoming a more socially engaging city with varied sports arenas, venues and complexes such as track and field, soccer, skateboarding, basketball, baseball, and ice skating. The Waterfront provides for concerts and special events including fundraising.  There is a nightlife in our trendy NuLu area but is not very diverse.  The desire I have about Louisville is the particular pockets of our different communities had more of a presence.  We do have pockets of rich cultural opportunities but not strongly highlighted.  We have a strong Latino community, Asian community, African community and African American community.  Concerning professional opportunities we have a compelling medical society.  Families would benefit from living here.",

We have a wonderful public and charter school system, great undergraduate colleges and programs, and superb graduate schools and programs. I also love the many corporations and job opportunities our city has to offer, along with the diversity of the residents in Memphis, TN. Oh yeah, not to mention the fantastic historical attractions located in downtown Memphis, and the many tourist attractions and activities as well, by the way, we also have a professional basketball team, \"The Memphis Grizzlies\", and a professional football team, \"The Tennessee Titans\". Memphis, Tn. home of the down home blues, soulful baptist churches, and excellent educational opportunities, Go Memphis!",

In Memphis there is no way you can be bored, there are so many activities to participate in, there are some of the best places to eat, and some of the best hang out spots for you and your friends. Many people think Memphis is a horrible city for it's crime rate when actually if you know what you are doing it is not bad at all. Memphis is known for it's diverse culture and cuisine. Here you can find some of the oldest dining places, and there are stories every where you look of historical importance.",

It is a good place for young adults to get their feet off of the ground because of the affordability, yet still offers fun things to do for young people. The University of Memphis is a decent school and is very inexpensive compared to other state schools. Although I will likely leave before having children of my own here because of the poor public school system, I know that Memphis will always have a special place in my heart!",

Our art museums, Bradford Beach, and for the adults the clubs and bars that can be easily frequented are all just small parts of things that make this city what it is today. However, what with some people not necessarily being used to outside attention, or our ability as Wisconsinites to not speak right away to someone on the street, it is imperative of those who chose to visit us that they keep an open mind. Sometimes the people that do not speak end up being the nicest you’ll ever meet!",

Also, Milwaukee has Summerfest every year which is a really fun week of music and food. Many popular bands and singers come to Summerfest each year. It's a cool area because the festival grounds is on Lake Michigan. When I went, I saw Jason Derulo. Not only is there Summerfest, but there's Irishfest, Germanfest, Polishfest, Festa Italiana, and more! \n\nI definitely recommend Milwaukee for everyone.",

Crime has reached it's peak in Albuquerque and hasn't calmed down for quit some time. In 2021 Albuquerque has surpassed it's amount of murders in the metro area for the year before. In the media, I feel, they treat it like a glorified way for them to boast their resumes so they move on to a better city or state. I know that I'm supposed to have something positive about Albuquerque in this review but honestly I just can not. This is my home, where I was born, where I was raised, but I have never wanted anything more for my life but to leave this place immediately! I know for myself as an adult and, hopefully someday, a parent, I will not be starting a career or raising a family in this town because of what I have seen and experienced. My intent is certainly not to offend anyone from Albuquerque, just to let people know how I feel from my prospective.",

A melting pot where Native American, Mexican, Spanish, and American cultures come together. The geography surrounding Albuquerque is like none-other, with the Sandia Mountains as it back drop to the east, the Rio Grande river flows straight through the city, and the Petroglyph National Monument to the west. Albuquerque is one of America's cities with the most parks! Spend a day at Robinson Park playing disc golf, take one of the cities hundreds of miles of bike paths to the Rio Grande Bosque, and finish the day watching the breathtaking sunset in the foothills of the Sandias.",

When we were researching moving out here 3 years ago, everything we read online was that ABQ was just a horrible crime ridden area, and while there are some tough parts of town, nothing could be further from the truth. The community here is very friendly and family friendly, and I love all the diversity and culture in the city. If I could pick anywhere to live during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic it would be ABQ. The Mayor, public health officials, and community at large has done and excellent job at protecting one another and helping one another during this very difficult time. I also love all the various beautiful locations across the state that are just a short drive away. Overall this city is extremely family friendly and beautiful. I am so very glad that we didn't turn down the opportunity to live in this awesome city because of all the negative reviews we read about online. I give Albuquerque a 10/10",

Let's not forget about the shopping centers! I would like to see a change in regards to the homeless people living in our community its not only looks like the town if not worthy of living in but also to help the ones in  need, to work as a community and be seen as equals. I would like to see a change with drug usage and gang and for crimes to go down. I would like to feel safe in the community i'm living in. Overall it has great educational opportunities for the young and the adults and lots of job opportunities. Fresno is only growing and becoming better. I would recommend living in fresno for long term living or short term. Fresno is family friendly and its diversity ranges in all types.  Commuting is not horrible just when you're late you'll hit rush hour and be extra late or the weekends the traffic is horrible. I would recommend",

The Fresno area has a thriving economy, warm and accepting population, and a culture that places community with a focus on individuality at its core. Sought out by technology, scientific, and business for it’s highly educated residents, Fresno also possesses the States flagship University (CalState Fresno) which adds to the cities energy. The city is a wonderful combination of Urban, urban/suburban, Suburban, and rural areas that mesh well with each other and allow Fresnoians to live and experience many lifestyles within a short drive. Cost of living is expensive but so are salaries so most people live comfortably. The nicest areas have to be North Fresno with all the mansions. Fresno is a great place and the downtown keeps on remodeling!",

Relatively low cost of living.\n\nNot a bad place to visit either. An hour away from the front gate of Yosemite and the the Sequoia Redwoods of the Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Forest, 2 hours away from great beaches. For those days that its good not to be in Fresno! \n\nI won't sugarcoat it, in the summer, Fresno is hot. At least 20 days of 100 degree weather in July. \n\nReal estate is inexpensive,  but more expensive now since people(from the Bay Area and SoCal) discovered it over the last year. I'm waiting for summer so they can discover that Fresno is hot and they shouldn't live here! But with bad luck, they will instead discover...\n\nFresno is a nice place to visit, and I like living there.",

Comfortability comes easy in Tucson since it has plenty of options for food, active living, options for the elderly, a tight knit medical community, a diverse setting of people who develop different parts of the city to integrate efficiently, and cheerful and helpful citizens. While this Southwest City has its problems with safety so to speak (historically speaking) most places have become extremely safe especially when you travel in small groups or at least attempt to not mind the street dwellers of the community. While racially fueled gang violence was once a problem, nearly all members of the community now bond over culture as a main attraction to the city. No matter what your interest is, Tucson probably has it somewhere!",

Only 45-minutes away from the Mexican border, the culture that thrives here is incredible and don't get me started on the food! Recognized as a City of Gastronomy, the food and life that resides in Tucson is one of a kind. Residents are kind and welcoming and provide great hospitality. Also, as home to the University of Arizona, the college spirit is always thriving! Come to Tucson and experience it yourself!",

It's not a super large city so it fun to see how everyone knows, or how they are connected to people. Most people are excepting to a bunch of different believes here! The only thing I would change is the public school system here. As a person going to a public school, I would like to see the district take better care of the schools. Some of the schools are great here but TUSD already doesn't have the best representation for public schools. The only other thing I would change here is the nightlife, in downtown Tucson nightlife is gorgeous but here on the outskirts it can be a little lame, and slightly more dangerous (for obvious reasons). Our governor is doing everything he can right now to make Tucson a better city, which I am really grateful for. Our roads are being worked on for the first time in a while, creating less accidents. Thank you!",

If you want a more low-key outing, there are plenty of restaurants, stores and recreational spots to check out. Go to the drive-in movies, practice your golfing and bowling skills, visit a museum, or shop till you drop. The eateries in Sacramento are unparalleled. They don't call us the Farm-to-fork Capitol for nothing! \nSacramento's historical victorian architecture can still be seen in the neighborhoods of Midtown and East Sacramento. Exploring the beautiful homes is an activity on its own. \nIf you can handle the heat and the traffic in Sacramento, you will be gifted with friendly faces and endless opportunity!",

Definitely plan on building a life in this city.",

Busses will even come and pick up your kids from your house or very close to it if need be.\n\nThe area is very family-friendly and has a ton of stuff for everyone of all ages. There are parks, baseball courts, shops, movie theaters, restaurants, etc. It's a great place for a family to visit or live.\n\nThe job market is booming out here with all of the tech companies coming and building offices out here. We are getting a Facebook office, an Amazon center, and a Google building. We already have a massive Apple complex right across from a neighborhood and it is expected that more and more tech companies will come out here which will only create more jobs and raise property value. \n\nThanks for doing this scholarship Niche!",

It is considered to be a positive addition to the city of Mesa.\nWelcomed By Sculpture On The Streets,  You might just see Humpty Dumpty or a mama bear waiting on a Mesa street corner. But don’t worry that you’re starting to hallucinate from the sweltering Arizona heat—they’re part of the 38 sculptures in the city’s Growing Permanent Sculpture Collection.

There is a lot of things and stores close by, which make life a lot easier. Being close to Tempe, makes for a great night life. And, Mesa has a lot of fun date activities like escape rooms, paddle boats, billiard rooms, etc. If I met someone who was looking to move to Mesa, I would tell them to take the jump! I would tell them this because, it is almost like a breath of fresh air and there is lots of different housing around and opportunities to get employment. We are also extremely close to lots of schools, which make it a great place for someone who is starting their education or looking to continue their education. Mesa has made a great home for me and my little family. Great place",

It's a mid-size city which provides \"city life\" while not being overwhelming. There are plenty of affordable housing options in and around the city, many from $500-600 a month, and cheaper options can be found with roommates as well. The media gives KC a bad rap with crime, however the majority of the city is extremely safe and I have rarely felt uncomfortable or unsafe in my day-to-day life.",

KCMO(Kansas City, Missouri) and KCK (Kansas City, Kansas) remain two seperately incorporated cities but together, along with a number of other cities and suburbs, are a part of the KC Metro area. Most activities/attractions, including fine dining and lodging, are centrally located about 15-30min from anywhere in metro area. AMAZING food, especially if you're a BBQ fan! Non-accredited schools and violence/murder rate are biggest downfalls.",

However, a lack of proper public infrastructure planning, specifically targeting roads, and uneven economic development highlights the key issues of Atlanta. Near the center of Atlanta, traffic congestion is horrendous leaving people on the roads for an hour or more depending on the destination. In reference to uneven economic development, some neighborhoods suffer from a lack of governmental attention. The residences tend to lack proper appearance and are littered. In addition, attention from public services is lacking in the area. Overall, Atlanta is a wonderful city for people looking for an urban life, however some areas are too overwhelming or others are not properly taken care of.",

There are many places to visit and its restaurants are amazing. Not to mention it's fun parks and museums in which I visit every so often. Atlanta has a variety of malls and shops to go to like Lenox Mall, Phipps Plaza, Atlantic Station, etc. The Mercedes Benz Stadium is one of my favorites, they hold all kinds of events there and the view inside the stadium is beautiful. Atlanta is also very diverse, it's very different from any other city I've visited. It's also a great city to go to if you're looking for jobs, because the networking there is extraordinary, you will always run into someone that's in the industry or career field you want to go in.",

The city looks to be expanding and building a lot more homes and apartments. There’s a park on every corner and plenty of amazing places to eat, including multiple vegan options and a variety of different cuisines. The schools are good I’ve heard, I haven’t been to one firsthand, though. Everyone is walking their dogs and bringing their kids along with them, which gives a family friendly feel. Obviously, this isn’t the most diverse city in the country, but you do meet all kinds of amazing people if you look! The Universities here are also really great, with large, medium and smaller schools to fit everyone’s needs, along with amazing culinary schools. I’m excited to see how much Omaha really grows and would definitely recommend young families to look into moving to Omaha if the opportunity arises!",

I enjoy things like eating out, going for walks to the library, watching sports, and looking at some cool art during my free time.  There is the College World Series, parks everywhere, and Kansas City is just a two hour drive if you are a chiefs fan. There is one fallacy though, because of past implementations of redlining the city is still segregated to a degree. Some schools are very diverse though, along with other popular places such as the malls and the Zoo. In conclusion, I'm happy with Omaha because of the ability I have to do things that I enjoy.",

I had just finished my freshman year in a tiny town in Iowa, and I was excited to finish the next three years of my high school experience in that simple town. When I moved, it was one of the hardest things for me to say goodbye to all my friends, and school became so much harder for me as well. However, I worked extremely hard in school, and I earned good grades because of it. I learned that putting in extra time and effort was all I needed to keep my grades where I needed them and the work ethic that I developed throughout high school is something I will never trade. However, I also learned to get out of my comfort zone socially. Initially, making new friends was very hard for me, but I learned to open up and be more accepting of change in my life. Now, I am able to see the beautiful city of Omaha for all the great things that it is. I have had so much fun living in Omaha these past few years. It has really been a blast!",

The downtown area is clean and well-groomed, and there are a variety of both indoor and outdoor activities in close proximity to each other, including mountain biking, hiking trails, locally owned vintage shops, mid-range to high-end dining, etc. There are many military bases in Colorado Springs, and therefore many Colorado residents are military, or come from military families, and also spend much of their time outdoors. There is a diverse mix of age, race, and background. One of the down sides is that it is very expensive to live in Colorado Springs. Although there are job opportunities, housing is extremely limited, and a one bedroom apartment in downtown Colorado Springs could cost upwards of $1,200/month.

I moved back to Raleigh after four years in western NC for college, and I had forgotten how much there is to do in the capitol city. Downtown has seen quite a bit of growth in the past few years with the addition of many new businesses, restaurants, nightlife and activities. I recommend Amorino Raleigh for desserts, Sir Walter Raleigh for coffee, Parkside Restaurant for dinner, Just Salad for lunch, North Hills and Cameron Village for shopping, the Red Hat Amphitheater for concerts, Historic Oakwood for a stroll, and Drive Shack for a late-night activity. Between the exceptional pubic schools, diverse communities, range of activities, and the bustling nightlife- there is no place like Raleigh, NC!",

It's the largest small town I've ever been in. It's diverse, it's community-based, and it has a little bit of something for everyone. Each community within Raleigh is a place of it's own and offers their own unique features and offerings. The historic district, north hills, crabtree valley; all are Raleigh, yet uniquely their own.  How exciting!",

A lot of great public schools, especially colleges for furthering education ( ncstate, methodist, William peace etc). There are several affordable places to live/  enjoy and with family/friends (fun activities). I do know they have free events every month, especially around the holidays. I know Raleigh have many restaurants for vegetarians, meat and sweet lovers. The community is very diverse. Majority of the people I have met are friendly and supportive. There are plenty or non-profits/organizations that helps those that are need for assistance. A lot of volunteering occurs as well which is a blessing. The commute isn't too bad as long as you go with the flow of traffic. The police department do their best to get to those on need during on, off call. Overall, I have to say Raleigh is a great place to live, or visit. Its always something great to do there!",

Strong military presence, visit the Wisconsin for some military history and a sense of national pride! Be aware that there will be rush hour traffic and bridge opening you should plan your traveling around. Of course the local beaches are amazing but visit when it’s not the peak of summer! Unless you want to come for something in the water, it was canceled because of the pandemic but the previous year was amazing. A lot of big name performers have concerts at Veterans United.  There is a lot of outdoor fun to be had too! Rent paddle boards or kayaks for a fun day on the water. Or experience whale watching and dolphin tours, and my favorite the pirate ship tour!",

The downtown living is exciting and fun with many different restaurants and bars at walking distances.  There are many events that help keep the community active.  In downtown, the Performing Arts Theater has different events from plays, concerts, and talks.  For the children, Disney on Ice and other concerts are frequently playing.  You can see,  the city  has something for everybody no matter age, sex, or race.  The pier has a variety of different eateries, shops, and entertainment like an arcade.  There is a large, newly renovated aquarium that offers special events.  As far as special attractions, the Queen Mary is still in Long Beach and very popular with tourists.  It is very nice to see the history and learn about the city.  If you are lucky, you can also see movies or commercials being filmed in the city as well.",

          "body": "Long Beach, depending on your financial background, can be a beautiful city or a city that needs a lot of improvements. Living cost here for low-income community members is detrimental and most of the time folks will find themselves working so many hours that it's hard to enjoy the city life. There is an obvious wealthy population of folks who do enjoy their life near the beach but of course, that comes at the expense of the low-income citizen. One can definitely see gentrification coming in slowly but surely which is something that the local government has done a poor job of addressing. But there are some moments where community members will come together through creative mediums and uplift the spirits of those who are the backbone of our beloved city.",

Not only does it offer many day excitement, but this city also brings the party at night with plenty of bars and clubs.  Long Beach is also the home to Cal State Long Beach where students can attend their studies, but also enjoy the exciting city.  As a future Cal State Long Beach student, I will be looking forward to spending my days here in this marvelous city.  Long Beach is also very close to neighboring beaches such as Huntington Beach, Newport, and even Laguna Beach, which are gorgeous beach staples here in Southern California.  This city can offer a great time for anybody who wants to have a California beach style getaway or just a place to be.  Long Beach is also the home to great tourist attractions like the Queen Mary, Aquarium, Convention Center, Performing Arts Center, and of course, the beach itself.  This place is joy.",

There are literally supermarkets at any corner. Public transportation works very well and the trains too. There are a bunch of activities to do all around the city, restaurants were my favorite part of it, fresh and latin very well done food. Visiting the beaches is a must! As for now Haulover Park is my favorite spot. If any night you feel like going out with some friends, Wynwood or Miami Beach are good options, there are a tons of bars and very nice restaurants. \nYou could also enjoy going to any park and some of them offer some activities, like in Bayside there are one or two days a week that could go to do Yoga. I would say that the city is very safe, but of course, like every other part of the world, you always have to be careful when you are around areas you do not really know that much.",

          "body": "Miami is an urban city and one of the most known cities in the world. It is a beautiful and splendid place to live in. It's a city that brings countless opportunities to the people and helps you grow in all possible ways. I lived in Miami for seven consecutive years and in my opinion, it's a place where you can have peace, enjoy shopping, go out with friends and family, enjoy a variety of restaurants and places to visit, and participate in any of the community events. Based on my experience, Miami is safe and it cares for its people no matter their social class. The only issue in this city is affordability. Miami is somewhat expensive as a result of tourism and overpopulation. I absolutely recommend Miami to everyone and I encourage you to visit it one day. Thank you for your time in reading my short response. Have a wonderful and great day!",

The weather is amazing, the people are friendly, diverse and active. There are tons of events, great food scene and nightlife (although since covid it's been a little harder to explore these areas). There is also tons of great outdoors activities, such as hiking in the Joachin Miller park. It's a great mix of city vibes, but chill and laid back at the same time. If you're thinking of moving to the bay area, I highly suggest choosing Oakland!",

It's sad to see Oakland is becoming more and more money-driven though because it's pushing native residents just like my family and me out to make space for strip malls and monetary attractions that could be housing people. Some might say the bad stereotypes of Oakland fit my neighborhood, but what they usually don't see are the wonderful people who have and plan to stay here for years to come. If the city wasn't becoming so overcrowded and money-hungry I would rate it higher, but I wouldn't dare rate it any lower because there truly is something special about the cultural understanding and bond people from my city have and share.",

I came here for college (and there are a number of small colleges that do an incredible job and that facilitate connections between themselves, in addition to the massive U of M), but I stayed for the community. I was especially hooked by the vibrant community of artists and makers that ensure that our city is always full of creativity, new life, and fun for people of all ages and all walks of life. We are also a beautiful melting pot of cultures, and I love that my neighborhood represents that diversity in its residents, its shops, its restaurants, and the languages used by community organizations. The biggest drawback is the winter, but even that is fun when embrace it (like through sledding and hot cocoa)!",

It's an intersection of many different histories, which are celebrated, and sometimes passionately debated, by its residents.  Minneapolis is an underrated city, primarily due to the perception of its far north (read: cold) location, but also because the residents want to keep it to themselves. It is a poorly kept secret though, as evidenced by with the influx of young people relocating to the city.  People stay in Minneapolis for many reasons, not least to experience the most magical spring/summer/fall seasons.  With over 11,000 bodies of water to choose from, and at least one park in every neighborhood, it's never far to be immersed in nature.  The city makes a concerted effort to make programs available to all of its residents, regardless of economic resources, with exposure to sports programs, nature experiences, empowerment and educational experiences for little to no cost. It is a wonderful place to live.",

The city has many amazing opportunities for jobs and is definitely great for someone looking for a career. I also love the insane amount of parks and outdoor opportunities, although it is only accessible during the warmer months. The city also manages to be very small for what it offers, and is really easy to get around. The people are also really great and the city is diverse.\n\nHowever, Minneapolis has definitely changed in the past few years. Crime has become a MAJOR issue here and the city management is corrupt and incompetent. I live in a fairly decent neighborhood and I still find myself worried for my safety. I am especially worried about getting carjacked, as the sheer number of these crimes is absolutely insane. Gunshots are also very regular. Overall, I think this city is not going in a good direction, which is an absolute shame given all of the it’s other positive aspects.",

I truly believe that for a relatively small US city, Tulsa packs a punch.  Navigating the city is very manageable due to the roads being arranged in a grid-like pattern.  There's sort of a joke that you can make it anywhere in the city within 15 minutes, which is actually pretty accurate!  The people are incredibly friendly, a unique combination of southern hospitality and city quirk.  The public schools are unfortunately one of the city's biggest downfalls.   A majority of our public schools are short-staffed and under-funded, though in my experience Tulsa is lucky to employ many teachers that are dedicated and exceptional role models.  Overall, I have no qualms with having grown up here and no intention on moving away from the city any time soon!",

What we do not like and am saddened to see is that this town (and surrounding cities) do not clean the town, and there is litter everywhere! I do not understand why citizens care so little about their town as to toss garbage everywhere. The hotel we were staying at, almost every day we saw garbage strewn in the parking lot, half eaten food and drinks just tossed on the pavement. As well, the cities here do not fix or repair roads. There are huge dangerous potholes on major streets that have been there for many years. We almost ruined our car driving. What is the taxpayers' $$ going to? \nIt could be a great town if they cared enough to clean up.",

It has also been said that there is little education opportunity, don't know exactly how factual that may be but I would say from my experience that it is pretty accurate. Growing up in Bakersfield was alright, crime rates are pretty average, we aren't pouring with crime but we also can't say it's not a thing to worry about either. Bakersfield can look nice around the Stockdale area but once you're closer to the eastern side things start to look a little messy. The two well known education plans right after high school that you can get here is either at \"Bakersfield College\" or at \"California State University, Bakersfield\". Bakersfield College seems to be a good school, they have good programs, food, and campus, they are even remodeling a bit around the main campus. I can't say much about California State University, Bakersfield, I have not visited the campus.",

It really does have a small town feel, while having the benefits of a city. There's actually quite a lot to do, whether it's traveling to the mountains, or the beach, or staying and going to the park. It's close to everything, and it has low cost of living compared to most of California. And during the spring, it is one of the most beautiful places you can see. We have mountains all around us, and they get so blue during the spring. Great place to raise a family!",

I have had a nice home in my neighborhood and gangs are still ruining any chance of true acceptance of differences. There's so much hate & rage from gangs in Wichita. They disrespect senior citizens and young families with noise disturbances and drug usage and trafficking in plain sight.  The pandemic didn't help, either. It went from bad to miserable, with job loss and kids quitting school with no adult presence. Practicing empathy for others would be great! If any of the phonies posting here actually got out of their cliques and gave love to neighbors instead of apathy, Wichita would then be on the path to being a great city and peaceful neighborhoods. The things you really want to happen, start with love. Not hate.",

Growing up in Arlington was a blessed just because I know others would wish to have education and a better life. I was very lucky to get good academic support from my schools. I learned and grew academically each year to know successfully graduate.  I had the opportunity to make good friendships and get to know a lot of people. Arlington also has great amusement parks and other fun activities. For example, we have the AT&T stadium, the Parks Mall, outlets, highland, Six Flags, water parks, and more! Even though, I had a good experience there's some things I would change. One is the traffic as over the years it has gotten worse. There isn't much to do but to build more roads. Lastly, keeping this city clean. I have seen trash in parks and on the edges of the roads. I know it's big to make a change when you can't control how people think or were raised, but we can spread awareness.",

Areas are very clean and maintained. I enjoyed the public schools here, even though the safety isn't the best in them. I wish mental health was advocated more all around, and wish they weren't so harsh and strict on students. Some rules have gotten very excessive. Otherwise they're great with student involvement, courses and events. There are activities around the area too but not many. There are sport leagues and clubs for young ones.Again, neighbors are friendly as their pets are very friendly as well. Overall Aurora's great if you get involved!",

Growing up here has led me to the opportunities that are available to me, as well allowing me to experience life and look forward to the future I may have here. It may not always be rainbows and sunshines, but the beautiful days allow for some great times at the beaches, parks, and just a nice time outdoors. If you're considering visiting or moving here, it will surprise you with all that you can do here. Even a nice stroll on the boardwalk at night can be relaxing, or if you prefer a more energetic approach, the clubs in Ybor can be accommodating and exciting! There's plenty of diversity when it comes to food choices, whether you enjoy pizza, Spanish food, asian cuisine, or just a simple burger.",

If you want an affordable apartment, look for some roommates. \n\nI can speak to UNO, it's affordable and commuter-friendly. I love the art program, though it's criminally underfunded. \n\nIf you find yourself getting bored on a daily basis, that likely won't happen here! There's always an event, a concert, a parade or a festival to attend. I truly do love it here, but I recognize it's flaws and it's important to share them. \nBe careful finding an apartment, there are a few FB groups to steer you in the right direction. There's alot of gentrification in New Orleans, and it's swarming with AirBnBs that displace residents. Just do some research and be respectful of the people who have lived here for a very long time. :)",

Whether it's inviting rival fans over for tailgate BBQ or giving good guidance on the local haunts, you'll always feel \"a part of.\" The attractions are endless, from alligator swamps to Emirel's cuisine, there is an activity to suit everyone. I loved living uptown, where there was easy access to the streetcar and job opportunities were plentiful. And, the Audubon Zoo, Tulane University, famous cemetaries, and live music always. The most unique activityI observed was the Second line, a wonderful tradition of the celebration of life.  All things good and bad, I am glad to have been seduced by the city of New Orleans for almost a decade now.",

We have potholes everywhere, and when it rains, you start praying that your car won't flood.\n\nDespite it's problems, there are very few places in the U.S. I would rather live. The people that are drawn to New Orleans care are drawn to the city not for it's pragmatism. They are people that are drawn to the spiritual; to music and art, to culture. These are people that a value human experience and relationships. \n\nWe care about aesthetic. We care about celebrating life. It is all of these things that make me love New Orleans. These are the people I want to be surrounded by in life, because they remind me that life is bigger than ourselves. There is more to the world than the hamster wheel, the grind, our mundane and daily anxieties. New Orleans is a daily reminder that there is beauty in life and that people matter.",

Being multicultural has allowed many people to relocate here and still feel some kind of comfort. I love that we get all four seasons so it balances out all the American holidays and traditions such as swimming in the summer and ice skating in the winter, having snow for Christmas and the beautiful sight of fallen leaves in the fall.Cleveland also has many jobs and opportunities for you to grow professionally in different career paths. I appreciate the art that has been brought to the city from the modern landscaping to the architectural building in the inner city. I believe Cleveland has a great public education system and many colleges to continue your education. Last I love that Cleveland is overall affordable to live and try new experiences compared to other places. There are also many resources.Cleveland supports families.",

          "body": "Overall, I had an average experience in the city of Cleveland. I like a lot of aspects of my time here, but I dislike about as much. For example, I love how affordable this city is. I'm able to rent a decent sized house with one other person in a nice neighborhood for a very good price. In my neighborhood, I'm able to walk to bars, restaurants, and a boutique or two. I also really like the abundance of small businesses and breweries here- I love to try out craft beers!\nOn the other hand, Cleveland is not known to be the safest city. There are quite a few areas of the surrounding area that I would not feel comfortable venturing in. Most of the year is quite cold, and since I'm not a fan of snow, this really doesn't appeal to me! Finally, if you want to drive anywhere, you have to get on a highway. Everything you'd need is so far apart, but maybe some of that just comes with city living. Cleveland is not the place I want to live for the rest of my life, but I'm happy right now.",

It had parks, supermarkets, stores, libraries, bakeries, bars, skating rinks, a water park, beaches, hiking locations and etc. I had many great memories with friends and family and it was a place I could call home. The education that is given in the public schools are excellent! Some things I would like to see change is the homeless rate in the area. Wherever you went you could see at least one unfortunate person, even at my middle school there was a man who stayed by the gym. I would also like the overall racism to change, everyone knew it was there, but most didn't speak up about it. There were many jokes, slurs, and stereotypes heard when I was there and it didn't seem like they were going to stop any time soon.",

Traffic has gotten increasing terrible as people have flocked here to live. There's been the promise of rail that has been delayed more times than I can count. And the rail stops planned will benefit very few.\n\nJob? Expect to get paid less than any other major metropolitan area like NY.  Except your cost of living will be astronomical.\n\nSchools? There are public schools that are okay, or spend a pretty penny on private school (~25k/yr).\n\nDiversity? Excellent! I wanted my kids to grow up around multiple cultures like I did.\n\nCrime? Things have been getting worse as Oahu has become more populated and there is an increasing homeless problem.\n\nPros, when you're not working your butt off to pay rent/mortgage, beautiful weather, excellent hiking, and crowded beaches. Overall, I have weighed the pros/cons and am planning to move away.",

As a isolated island Hawaii offers an impressive variation in food, culture, language, and music. The islands also attract many people from all over the world who can easily appreciate the vibrations of the island. The agriculture is breath taking from the mountains to the flowers, to the locally grown fruit. The beaches are amazing. You can enjoy a good book by the ocean, catch some waves with some surfing or boogey boards, snorkel, or just lounge around in the sun. All activities are welcomes including early morning exercise such as yoga and hula. The history of the islands are intriguing as well. Every morning while driving or walking into downtown Honolulu, one can pass by Iolani palace or give a shaka to King Kamehameha. Living in Hawaii has been a wonderful and rewarding experience.

In my subjective experience of the city in the whole of my life, I feel it has molded, shaped, and prepared me for life wherever I go in my journey. Stockton is a microcosm of the world, and for the most part throughout the time that I have spent in the city, I have encountered good-hearted people. Sure, there are the lemons that you inevitably come across, people with a sour disposition, but I suppose you're bound to encounter those types wherever you go. I liked that city offered me quality education through the schools that I attended like the parochial schools St. Gertrude's, St. George's, and St. Mary's, and then on to higher education at San Joaquin Delta College. The aspect of the city that I would change is the handling of the homeless crisis of the city. It has reached epic proportions and a resolution is needed.",

Changes don't happen often, and when they do, they're pretty small. They aren't anything amazing enough that brings people running out to see what's going on. The most exciting thing that's happened here recently was a Cane's Chicken Fingers opening. But that isn't to say there aren't good things. There are great coffee shops, like Peet's Coffee, and beautiful college campuses that are fun to walk around and have a picnic in. There are malls for good shopping and many local business that open up every so often. Stockton really is just an average town, but even though things can get boring after living here for so long, you also learn to appreciate the little things that we do have.",

I like this about Stockton because many people in the area have different religious backgrounds and can also many diverse types go foods and celebrations. One of the oldest college universities is located here is named University of Pacific. This university has been here since the year 1851. Another reason what I like about Stockton is the community College San Joaquin Delta College. This college is well known and is the best community college located in California. Something that I would change is the crime rate. The city nearly four times more than the national average. This city also includes many gang activity, high poverty rates, and high unemployment rates. If I would change anything, I would like to make it so Stockton is a safer place to live in.",

The streets are in much needed repair and the local city government is finally starting to take action toward fixing a problem that has been long overdue. If you like humidity and the beach scene, this growing city is the place for you! Locals here are friendly enough and keep to themselves most of the time. Sidewalks are also in need of repair. There are more restaurants springing up in town and that is always something exciting to try.",

A big enough town to have things to do and places to see, but also small enough to not get lost like bigger cities. The only thing that does bother me, is the constant road construction that has been going one since I was a baby. Also the crazy amounts of pot holes and bad roads. All in all, it is a great place to live!",

Experienced the life before and after the age of 21. While we dont have amusement parks or a huge variety of nightlife activity, there is still plenty of things to do. Our beach could use improvement as we are a tourist destination but our visitors leave our beaches trashed. Our streets could use improvement. We do get street repairs however, they tend to take about a year long to get one road finished. The school district definitely is need of some work. I now have a family of my own and I have moved to the outskirts of CC to ensure my children go to a better school district. Spending time down on Ocean Dr. is absolutely beautiful and is definitely one of my favorite places. You can enjoy several activities from jogging down the bayfront to rental jet skis! People say there is nothing to do here, however, if you look around, there is plenty to do.",

The communities are completely diverse, and you see people of all race & ethnicities. There's shooting ranges, movie theaters, sports stores, restaurants, retail stores, grocery stores, an ice skating rink, bowling alleys and a whole lot more. The parks are also pretty nice, they have a lot of parks in many different communities with many different options of activities like skating, biking, exercising, running, hiking, walking, picnicking, relaxing, and playing sports like soccer, basketball, baseball, football, hockey, handball, and kickball. There's even a few places with a public pool. The apartment areas are also really nice and filled with plants & trees in the surrounding areas. They mostly all have pools, work out rooms, laundry rooms, balconies, garages & gated communities. And there's a really drive-in!",

Another reason why I enjoy Riverside is that there is a lot of activities to do in the county. Such as food, events, fairs, farmers markets, bowling, and sports.A big reason I did not give a five star is because of how many homeless people have shown up to Riverside and how much trash they leave. We as a community are trying to keep the city clean , but it is a struggle trying to keep up with the litter. Other than that, I love living in Riverside!",

It is close to shopping, grocery stores, and just a few minutes from the freeway. Overall I would say it is positive. There are always areas to improve. The city doesn't come and street sweep on the right day, silly things like that for instance. \n\nRiverside is a very large city in comparison with my hometown.  The downtown area has lots of nice restaurants, and a cute vintage vibe. I have been to some areas here that are in need of help from the more affluent in the community. I have no personal experience with the school system or law enforcement. I am unable to offer a personal opinion on either.  However, this is my partners hometown, and he has nothing but good to say! It has been a good time so far!",

          "body": "Downtown Santa Ana is lively with several entertainment options, from movies, drag brunch, clubs, and bars, to a monthly art show, & street festivals. The entertainment options are quite eclectic, catering to everyone. There are restaurants and markets within Santa Ana that offer culturally diverse foods, making shopping and dining options more plentiful and varied. I live near the border of Santa Ana and Costa Mesa, and my house is walking distance from lots of great spots! I can walk to South Coast Plaza (a large mall), the Performing Arts Center, and many restaurants and stores. With that said, the walkability of this area goes down because of the city’s homeless population and lack of mitigation of it. It does not feel safe, especially after dark, even though it is in a relatively nice area, and many other neighborhoods in Santa Ana are even worse. I hope something can be done about this as I don’t want to have to rely on my car as my mode of transportation so I can feel safe.",

However, its not the most perfect and safest. There is a lot of gang influence and poverty that negatively impacts the community that's already subjected to latinx/hispanic stereotypes. I sincerely hope my city and community can bypass these barriers so everyone can have successful lives and change the city's reputation.",

          "body": "There are a lot of aspects that I love about Santa Ana. One aspect is the number of schools and teachers that work in Santa Ana that are very caring of their students and about them passing. I've seen teachers that tutor students and are always ready to help as they put their students first. While I attended Segerstrom High School, I had an awesome teacher that helped me out with my English, Math, and Science. Another view of Santa Ana is Mexican food, as most of the businesses that sell that are in my area are usually food trucks. One of my closest friends owns a taco stand called Bandito Taqueria, which makes the best tacos in the city. If I were to say one thing to change it would be more public transportation as the lacks proper transportation. Other than the bus there also aren't many travel options in general. Adding more transportation systems, while it would cost a pretty penny, fixes the huge problem every resident faces every day regarding transportation.",

Another thing that I'm extremely grateful for is the fact that Orlando has incredible student housing. I grew up in the metro Detroit area and student housing is jokingly (and somewhat accurately) referred to as prison and your roommate is your cellmate. Plus I have a lot of food allergies which has made eating out impossible in MI but I have found several restaurants in Orlando that have multiple options for me! The only downside is the traffic and how it takes 40 minutes to drive the 12 miles between my apartment by Valencia East campus and my parents' condo by Disney.",

There are tons of restaurants to try ranging from Mexican, American, Chinese, Japanese, and many more. The views from the Wheel are spectacular. You can see Disney, Sea World, and Legoland.  The Malls are great places to hang out with friends and get some amazing clothing and nerdy items. Overall I love Orlando!",

My friends and I would ride our bikes in the park and then get food from the University Town center. Irvine became a second home for my friends and I. We would study all day and night in the library and then we would go to the movies in the town center. On the weekend, when we did not have much studying to do, we would go to university town center to interact with other college students. Irvine is not only a great place to raise a family, it is also one of the safest neighborhoods around the area. Additionally, because Irvine is a college town there are many job opportunities If I could, I would live in Irvine to pursue my future buying a house and raising children. To add the cost of living in Irvine is high and over the years has gone up; however, I believe that the cost of living is worth the amazing lifestyle one with achieve by living in Irvine.",

Of course, no city is 100% safe, but Irvine does a really great job in making sure that things are taken care of to ensure that this city be can as safe as possible for the amount of people living in it. Irvine is a very affluent and diverse area, so you can expect to see a good amount of high-end areas and people from all sorts of cultures. As amazing as this city is, I will say that Irvine is definitely in a bubble compared to other cities, meaning that because it's so organized, that it can easily feel stifling and like there is not much to do in the sense of authenticity. People do tend to keep to themselves more often and because of that there can be a lacking sense of community to some. But overall, if you're looking for a safe, family friendly, and entertaining city to live or vacation in, Irvine is an amazing option!",

One of my favorite places to visit is the Irvine Spectrum mall because of the many places to shop, eat and socialize. I love coming with my friends and family to take the day off and simply enjoy each others company watching a movie or racing a competitive match on Mario Cart at Dave and Busters!  The Great Park also has many fun activities like hopping onto the carousel or (my personal favorite) viewing the whole city and become mesmerized by the landscape from a hot air balloon. This city is truly one of my favorites and holds many dear memories of me and my loved ones.",

We're big enough of a city to have professional sports teams and multiple D1 colleges in town, but not overwhelmingly large like New York, Chicago, or LA. My mom was raised here and has lived almost her entire life here, and she loves the sense of community the area has. Because the city and the greater metropolitan area (where I'm from) tend to be divided up into smaller communities, living in Cincinnati has a small-town feel, but you can easily escape into the crowd when going downtown. People from Cincinnati don't identify themselves as \"people from Mariemont\" or \"Hyde Parkers,\" we unify ourselves under the common city, Cincinnati, proving how strong the sense of community and togetherness the city brings.",

There are wonderful activities to do year round as well as several Fortune 500 companies that have their home bases in the twin cities. St.Paul has access to the Mississippi River and the wonderful urban center of Minneapolis. There are great education opportunities and a huge arts scene for such a relatively small city.  However, no where is without its flaws. There is a lot of separation between social economic groups and often times racial groups that leads to strange divides.",

There are tons of things to do year-round.  A perfect mix of urban and rural. Night-life is on-point as well.  A great place to raise a family.

Lots of fun stuff on Grand Avenue and the city certainly has character, however it’s a mostly sleepy city that closes down early in the evening.  People about as passive as you experience in most of MN, kind of hard to meet new people.  Most stare at you suspiciously and act nice out of nervous obligation. Rent historically a bit more reasonable for what you get over Minneapolis.",

These are some popular tourist attractions filled with fun things to do for the whole family, especially in the summer. One down side of Pittsburgh is the parking.

Furthermore, I absolutely love how many different restaurants Greensboro has! A few have even been featured in magazines and Food Network to include Scrambled Diner and Hops Burger Bar. My favorite thing about the city is how family-friendly and diverse it is. Just in my neighborhood, there are about 10 different ethnicity in my cul-de -sac.  This makes for a warm and embracing atmosphere, especially for the kids! My daughter will be able to grow up understanding cultural differences and values, and she'll be able to better connect with her peers because of it. It is a great place to live!",

St. Louis is a sports-fanatic city filled with loyal Cardinals, Blues, and soon soccer (St. Louis City; SLC) fans. St. Louis is a great place to stay, especially downtown if you love to see a light-filled environment at nighttime. Downtown St. Louis is a great place for sightseeing, especially by the historical, Gateway Arch.  Not only is the environment lovely, but so is the food. St. Louis is known for toasted ravioli, frozen custard, St. Louis styled pizza, gooey butter cake, etc. When you eat St. Louis' food, you will not be disappointed. It's amazing! If you're planning for a quick, spontaneous trip soon, I recommend that you think about St. Louis.",

The rich diverse history of the city. I enjoy the growing restaurant scene popping up. I enjoy the quaint little areas like the Central West End and downtown on Washington where residence can enjoy fine dining, shopping, and nightlife within walking distance of where they live. The city has beautiful architecture in the buildings and brick houses that's been here for a hundred years. Our city has some of the best public schools in the country. We have great city attraction such as the Saint Louis Arch, The St. Louis Zoo, and our new Aquarium. We have top notch hospitals such as Barnes and St. Louis University Hospital. I love that we that greet people by asking \"What high school  did you go to\". Summers are a blast here with free concerts and plays. Finally, the best thing about my city is baseball go Saint Louis Cardinals!",

Lincoln is a college town that also is the capital as well as a good sized city with an awesome downtown. We have such great diversity and culture for being in Nebraska and a huge array of events for families and adults (college game day anyone?). I moved here at 18 for college thinking I would leave immediately once I graduated but I fell in love with this city for its amazing art scene and fun live music events, now I never want to leave! If you're looking for city events & convenience (everything is within 15/20 min drive) with pockets of neighborhoods and shops with small town vibes (so walkable!), this is the place for you. One star off for the winter weather though, but we can't all live in Hawaii I guess!",

          "body": "Lincoln is large enough to have all the amenities of city life, but still maintains a small-town feel. It has an incredibly low crime rate, and a solid public works system that make the two very safe to live in. The school system is constantly growing with the increasingly diverse population, and combined with the presence of the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Wesleyan and Doane Colleges all nearby, the educational system as a whole is very strong. You can live closer to downtown or farther South in the wealthier areas to feel like you're in the city life, but travel only a few miles in either direction and you'll run into the country very quickly. The only real drawback to the city is it's transportation and roads. Lincoln is not seemingly equipped to handle cold weather (even though the winters can be brutally so). The roads department is not quick to respond to snow and ice whatsoever, so the city is effectively shut down during the first real snow of the season.",

I've encountered so many people in public who have been so warm and welcoming; it's honestly a culture shock. I would also say that, overall, the city of Plano is fairly clean and safe. In the previous town that I lived in, potholes were rampant, and the roads needed servicing. As mind-boggling as this may sound, I have not encountered a pothole yet (my car thanks me)! Living in Texas has been quite the joy, and there's an abundance of amazing towns and cities; however, Plano has it's own je ne sais quoi that makes it stand out. Plano truly is a city for everyone!",

Despite this, I have called Plano home now for 18 years and love it dearly. I have been all over the world from seeing the Eiffel tower in Paris, all the way to the mighty Great Wall of China, but nothing quite beats familiarity and more important home. The thing I cherish most about Plano is the many walking trails that it houses and I have made some unforgettable memories with both friends and families and strangers alike, all thanks to Plano.",

Downtown Plano has a lot to offer for the nightlife; amazing spots to eat, walk and beautiful urban sightseeings are available as well. Plano is a quiet place to raise a family, they provide good public education, friendly environment, good food. One thing Plano lacks is diversity, which is getting better now. People are always involved in some activities, walking their dogs, jogging and most importantly they are active on neighborhood safety. Homeowners get together to keep the area safe(night-watch). Overall Plano is the best place to make long-lasting memories with your family and friends, I know I did!",

I love going downtown and walking while eating hot dogs on a cold spring day, smoke coming out of my mouth. I love going skiing during the winter and playing tennis during the summer. I love the endless daylight that we receive in the summer and the limited sunlight we get during the winter.  I might have a bias towards Anchorage in a good way since I was raised and born here, but I recommend those who prefer a quiet city rather than a loud and big city should come here. You get to see glaciers, go on hikes and see the wonderful nature that happen in Anchorage. I for sure rate it a 5/5.",

After two years, it still finds ways to enamor me with it's glorious views of mountains, oceans, and wildlife. That being said, it is an acquired taste, one myself am not the biggest fan of. There is a certain way of living up here that I can for the most part respect; most everyone here is living here to live by their own rules and generally keeps to themselves in regards to beliefs, showing a truly conservative nature. Everything that people will do for fun out here is outdoors- be it snowmobiling to hiking to fishing, everyone out here does things outside, especially in the summer time. While there are certainly things that Anchorage could fix, like the less than ideal education system or the crime rate, it certainly have loved the adventure of it all and I'm glad for having the experience of being up here for a few years!",

There's swimming, boating, motorized and non motorized as well as biking. Anchorage has been expanding its biking trails which is fantastic but there should be quite a lot of work put in on bike access on the roads. They do road improvements but don't upgrade to include bike lanes. There's a variety of restaurants, many local restaurants that are amazing as well as chain restaurants. Currently we lean pretty right but there's been some moves to the left in recent elections. The housing market is not great, though it's not as high for housing here compared to the states as it used to be, at least for buying, renting is very expensive as are utilities which add to the overall cost of living. There's not the same level of competition with utilities and cell / internet as in other places. I wish that there was better public transportation and less crime.",

I really miss the better hair/skin days, less bugs and dry heat.\nAlso the envious infrastructure. The grid system, maintained roads, highways. I could find ANYWHERE, even if I had never been there before, with someone telling me the freeway exit and which corner (ie northeast corner of 2 major streets). The lanes were wider and easy to get around in. If you missed a turn, you could easily take the next one or u-turn. Turning lanes and sidewalks everywhere! No tolls! Lots of parking lots, very rare steet or paid parking except for downtown (don’t move there).\nLots to do. Water parks, desert breeze park, the zoo, botanical gardens. There was mountainous hiking not too far away, 3D glow in the dark mini golf, ice rink, skating rinks, etc. Good froyo, cool drink and dessert spots, lots of Asian influence. Good eating like Greek, Vietnamese, Japanese…Oddly even the Wendy’s was good.",

I miss Atlanta's yummy delish food so much.  I love the mountains in and around Chandler.  They are great for a great workout!  I LOVE the weather in Chandler.  Although, today, is very cloudy and very cold!  I have gotten spoiled living in Chandler because the tempetures are usually in the 90's on up to 110/117!  YIKES!  Others complain like my relatives when they come to visit, most do anyway, but some love the hot tempetkres like I do. I only wish Chandler had great places to eat like Atlanta does.  The food in Chandler has zero flavor.  Whereas, Atlanta, I would go to my: African (Kenyan) spot, Ethiopian place, Mediterranean restaurant my friend owns, Laos where they know me well, Indian, where the food is made exactly the way I want it and they love seeing my presence, Vietnamese place where they make yummy tofu, and so many more",

As a suburb to the large city of Phoenix, it is a short drive from the thriving city life as well as from the outskirts of the desert for people such as myself that like outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and hiking. It is quite a safe place to live, even the low income sections of town are safe to walk at night. It mostly consists of middle class housing with some upper class neighborhoods. There are lots of highly acclaimed schools and jobs in all levels off the workforce. With its own well funded police department, it is a highly competitive to become a police officer and any form of bias is zero tolerance making it a very accepting place for people of any race, religion, sexual orientation etc.\nI was born and raised in this nice suburb city and do not plan to move far from it if at all!",

New housing development, along with booming restaurants and go to markets make this surburban lifestyle an optimal choice. With easy access to toll road 125 freeway, easy commute to and from destinations. Beautifully landscaped with excellent schools such as High Tech High, which immediate family members of mine have attended. I for one, enjoy being Chula Vista Resident as countless others!",

There are so many good people in the community where I live, passing by my grandparents house who live 15 minutes from mine. It has been a very good life, and the schools here are so exemplary and incredible. There is a relatively amount of safety since there are a lot of neighborhoods. Even though there are many fast food places, I consider Chula Vista as average healthy. Plenty of Job opportunities, and living close to San Diego is amazing for its beaches, Universities and recreation centers. I am so proud of living in Chula Vista!",

There are many sit down places that offer tables to study aside from Starbucks like Panera, HappyLemon, and Lollicup. The malls in Fashion Valley, Bonita, and Otay Ranch are nice to hang out with friends and stroll through for hours. I do wish that here in Chula Vista and in my school district they invested more into our schools in terms of cleanliness and quality(both campus and teachers.)",

There are potholes everywhere! I have blown a tire more than once, and usually it's in parts that need the love and attention the most. Also I think that there needs to be more care of our veterans and homeless population in regards to housing, food, and mental health needs.

There is Nature park on Aliante Parkway.  They have a beautiful waterfall that is breathtaking!  Also, they have a dinosaur dig area for kids to explore digging for fossils.  This park also has tennis and volleyball areas.  Family's are always there enjoying the amenities.  The waterfall has been a popular backdrop for prom and homecoming pictures.  This park sits right next to a public library.  This makes for the perfect outing!  Grab a good book and then visit a great park.",

The five years I have lived here has shown me that this place is a horrible place to live and or raise children. \n\nAs housing is becoming more dense in North Las Vegas, the city refuses to improve public transportation. There only focus is changing the highway interchanges W-215 and N-15. If you work on the AF base or any where around North Las Vegas, be prepared for horrible drivers. People here are very selfish and have a \"where's mine' attitude. No real sense of community and no public spaces besides the local Costco/Walmart. The sidewalks are tiny in some parts and people are in such a rush to go home it can feel uncomfortable walking anywhere. \n\nCrime is not as bad in North Las Vegas compared to Downtown. But, the lack of community gives a sort of uneasiness. Las Vegas is zoned in a way that seperates low income with high income areas. So, unless you're willing to overspend on cheaply constructed house GL!",

Along with the several other locations there is a nearby bank, community center and park. While having a positive diversity of business and locations in the neighborhood it unfortunately lacks of safety. Due to the fact of insecurity there are thefts,  disturbances, vandalism, and trespassing of property.

Overall, Gilbert is a wonderfully maintained city. All residential and commercial planning is always executed with efficiency, artistry, and an immaculate taste in landscaping. I'm proud to be a resident of Gilbert, Arizona and quite honestly I couldn't think any better place to continue my path to a better future!",

I moved here from a small town in Tennessee, so I love how everything is in walking or biking distance because my mom was a single mom and worked night shift, so after school my siblings and I had to get ourselves around independently. It is a bonus Gilbert is such a safe community as well!",

It feels very safe, has a fairly reasonable affordability (especially compared to places on the coast), and has great amenities (extensive bike path system, metro transit). The only downside for me is that the food is not as good as everyone thinks. Coming from the east coast where seafood is actually fresh and incredible cuisine is abundant, the food scene here is a bit of a step down.",

But living somewhere we have over 250 days of sunshine a year is pretty great! \nThe only thing I would change about Reno is the fact that I wish it stayed a small college town.

Relatively low crime for its size, surrounded by small towns with farms and manufacturing. Revitalization downtown. Restaurants and family-friendly activities: Fort Wayne Children's Zoo (ranked in top 10 of the country), Botanical Gardens, the Tincaps ballpark, outdoor concerts at Foellinger and Sweetwater or indoors at the Coliseum and Piere's and Clyde, venues for live theatre, and the Build Guild for arts & crafts classes, plus arcades, etc. Dining staples of Fort Wayne's Famous Coney Island and Power's Hamburgers and others. A few drive-in movies, roller rinks, and bowling alleys are in the city or within driving distance. Virtual reality, spas, escape rooms, skate parks, a nice ice-skating rink. River activities like kayaking. Trail system is great but bike lanes are few and far between. There are large lakes within 45 minutes - 2 hours from Fort Wayne.",

My husband and I started our family business here and raised 3 children because it was a very affordable place to live and we plan to stay. Fort Wayne is growing! Overall my experience has been fantastic due to the very manageable cost of living, the incredible people I have made friends with and the family oriented environment.  From my experience Indiana has been a good place to do business. I also have loved Indiana's central location for family road trips. It has been exciting to see Fort Wayne's promising economic development and to see an overall sense of momentum building. The city leadership has many development projects in the pipeline such as the  riverfront development, the continued growth of the trails and greenways, the development of an arts campus, the development of the North River property, and commercial and infrastructure improvements in the Southeast.",

Jobs are plentiful if you are in the medical field, sales, retail or fast food, but don't expect much in the way of pay/hours. There's not much to do but I'm an introvert so that doesn't bother me. Crime is awful on the southeast & west central sides. The humidity will kill you in the summer, especially now it seems global warming has taken hold. September used to be cooler, it's 90 degrees today. If you're near the highway (69 or 469) you can get across town pretty quickly, otherwise you'll drive at least 25-30 minutes through town. Plenty of big box stores & smaller chains, restaurants, including vegan choices.  Very nice zoo & colleges. Rent varies, north side of town has ridiculously high prices for very small apartments.  West side of town is still decent priced and safe.  Do not live on the south side.",

In fact, a large reason for wanting to come to Texas Tech was because of how friendly people were. Furthermore, Lubbock is a foodie paradise, filled with great locally owned restaurants and franchise's.

With beautiful beaches, parks and various nature spots, St.Petersburg is the perfect place to experience a tropical, island-like living in the state of Florida! This city also boasts a capturing downtown area with mouth-watering restaurants and cafes as well as museums including that exhibiting the works of the great Salvador Dali. After being in St.Pete for two years, I find that many individuals are not aware of this beautiful getaway city which is just about 15 minutes away from the prominent city of Tampa. With that being said, what I’d like, is for St.Petersburg to be more properly advertised and see more visitors each year!",

Online and social media, there are multiple sources that post and update events and organizations held every single night. The city is generally safe and I have never had a bad experience thus far. The murals and small businesses are the heart of Saint Petersburg, really making it unique to any other place I have been to. The most beautiful beaches are close by, at St. Pete beach. There is Pass-a-grille, Indian rocks, pinellas point, upham beach, and more. Whether you want to be outside exercising and exploring, or socializing and embarking on the night life, Saint Petersburg is the place for you.",

Much job growth after the pandemic has headed down to cities in Florida.  Specifically, the Miami area and Tampa Bay area have seen numerous businesses migrate from other parts of the country.  With these new businesses transplanting, employees must follow.  Also, since Tampa Bay is surrounded by water there is a limited supply of homes in the area.  The recipe of employees with increasing wages and higher demand for homes with a limited supply will result in appreciating home prices. Tampa and St. Petersburg homes will have significant appreciation over the next ten years for reasons aforementioned.",

Because ALL the teachers left because they didn't like Laredo. The actual \"cool\" places are counted. There are maybe like 2 art galleries (not always open), no actual good museums, nightlife very limited, not a lot of local restaurants but there are some good ones. There are good public and private schools. The public transportation sucks.  The average income of a Laredo resident is $15,127 a year. The US average is $28,555 a year!",

The people are mostly Hispanic but, they are extremely respectful and homelessness is not as common as a big city like Austin.  I have lived in laredo mostly all my life and when I was there, I hated living there.  The weather is hot mostly all year, the city was calm and I believed better opportunities existed elsewhere.  BOY, WAS I WRONG. I moved to Austin looking for a change.  Well, I experienced, hatred for police (which I am), homelessness EVERYWHERE, people have ZERO respect, families are almost non existent because the kids have no respect AT ALL.  Complaints for everything.  This is Austin.  So, if you complain about Laredo being boring, the my advice (STOP).  It is a place you will miss once you're away.  I speak from experience.  OH and the crime rate IS NOT bad nor the driving compared to places like here. The night life doesn't matter as long as you have your family.  Mexican food there is better than here",

It seems a bit barren all year. The south library is wonderful. I really love Heritage Park being right there with all the ducks and features in the park. There are a lot of opportunities for events the library offers for free, such as education for gardening, arts and crafts, and children's activities.\nThe main thing I do not like about Irving is how littered it is! It really breaks my heart. I see people just leave bottles of their drinks on the ground. I've seen people throw trash in bodies of water. It really breaks my heart, because it's terrible for the environment. It's also not as enjoyable to be around. I wish there was more awareness about this to keep our environment clean. Irving is also dangerous at times. It isn't terrible, but there is a lot of dangerous driving and shooting guns to show off.",

We can take the TRE into Dallas or Fort Worth. There's a plethora of restaurants. Grocery stores are plentiful. We're also very close to two Amazon warehouses so sometimes we'll order something and get it within hours. South Irving has an undeserved bad reputation. We bought an affordable house in a leafy area of older homes and it's been the best decision we've ever made. Our home sits on a quarter acre and we're able to have a huge garden. Our neighbors are diverse, kind and look out for one another. We plan to retire here, we love it so much!",

Some small neighborhoods are quieter and safer than others(Las Colinas, University Hills) which is something to look out for when house hunting. I moved here from South Florida and the I appreciated the diversity in North Irving right away. I didn't know much about the area, just that it was close to my job. But there are lots of restaurants, a convention center, dart (train) stops that'll take u directly to DFW terminal A. I mean, there are alot of pluses in Irving. Home prices are rising and I hope to afford to purchase in the same area I rent now.",

Our downtown is filled with street art and formal art. The only thing I would change is the cost of living. It is becoming more and more popular which makes things more expensive.",

I'm primarily thankful for the nuance of beautiful greenery across the landscape and lower cost of living. The people in Winston Salem have been a hit or miss in a huge way. Attitudes could use some adjusting and overall positive friendliness would go a long way (as it may anywhere). Customer service culture out here is incredibly out the window. Driving here feels extremely chaotic with no grid system or sense of predictable \"areas\". Instead it can feel unsafe and upscale all on the same block, or run-down and safe just the same. When it comes to food here, I feel my taste-buds settling drastically from my competitive foodie hometown. However I am a fan of the attention to style and fashion. Thrift stores are full of good finds and I'd imagine the malls would be too. Lastly, I wish there were more parks, or at least easier to find, with how gorgeous the outdoors are.",

To my knowledge, it isn't overly expensive, and there is a diverse population of people for many outlooks on a single topic.  Now, the border state and \"things\";  the nightlife is few and far between since I have little interest in that area, there is a presence (not strong, but one that's there) of human trafficking from the occasional bout on the news, lots of wrong-way drivers, and poor respect for the public school system.  Overall though, there are lots of good people that warm the heart.",

The mall around the area has many fancy and expensive places to go and experience new things! There are quite a few problems however. The first problem is that there are cameras at every light and will take pictures if you are speeding at all. It is very frustrating. The roads are horrible, and the people here are often stuck up and aggressive. Especially on the roads. I often struggle to get out of the house because I am stressed when I have to drive with people who are so stuck up and think that the road is theirs and theirs alone. The price of apartments and homes are too high for the quality of life. I think Scottsdale needs to change a lot of their scene to make it more appeasing to the middle class.",

It also is pretty low on crime and feels safe wherever you go. There are also lots of opportunities to be outside with parks and green belts and lots of community members made good use of them. It is nice to see so many people out walking, running, biking, etc. and does being in a sense of community which can be harder to find nowadays. Traveling through the city is also fairly convenience as the city runs more North to South which allows people to make use of the 101 freeway fairly easily. Main arteries also run along the city to make side streets a viable option when commuting. Although they can get busy during high commute times and street lights do add delay. There are some challenges though. Compared to other areas in the greater Phoenix area, Scottsdale has expensive real estate. More diversity is also needed!",

Supporting manufacturing, local business, and innovation is a steady consistency of the city. The public education system is very diverse reflected in the local population demographics. \nGarland has very obvious areas zoned for particular markets such as having areas where there is much industry, or other areas with many local car dealerships.\nLiving in Garland is not like many places in the country, there is not a radical presence of inequality, unrest, or crime. This in my opinion easily makes it above average compared to other areas.\nBeing near Dallas helps create a larger sense of community not present in other metroplexes. Sports, Texan culture, and constant activities makes it a great suburb for those looking to start a business, family, or a new life.",

Unlocked doors and leaving small objects in the yard without being worried about robbery. Very safe and loving. One thing I would love to change about Boise City is the Mentality of growth. Growth to this town scares people. When I say people I mean the older Cimarron county citizens. They think growth will change the town for the bad. What they don't realize is that without growth, the city is dying. Business owners are getting older and dying. Soon, without new industry, the town will become nothing. This brings me sadness because this town is so wonderful and seeing it die is horrible.",

As a college student, these are the types of people that I look for and would like to be around.\nOthers, especially some teens, can be rude and not welcoming, but of course that is anywhere you go. There are lots of nightclubs and parties at the universities near by. \nThe weather changes constantly, and the wind is ridiculous! There is also a lot of rain.\nOverall, Norfolk is not a bad place to live. Other than being here for college, I would not live here permanently.  My professor is real estate agent, and he says there are a lot of opportunities for buying and selling, and the real estate  business is very popular but also very profitable. In my opinion, Norfolk is increasing their police surveillance. There are always police officers on and near campus, and near the mall and the waterfront.",

We mostly always get a white Christmas and who doesn't love a white Christmas?! I really like the variety of schools in Spokane and mostly all of Spokane schools are highly rated. Going to downtown Spokane can get scary because the homeless population is increasing. I wish we could see a change in the crime rates and obiously there are much worse places than Spokane but for a place so beautiful, I would like it to be pleasant. All in all, I love Spokane and its people. I plan to live here and start a family here!",

Manito Park is a must see & is known for it’s multiple alluring gardens, in addition to being the perfect place for pets, families & friends to gather. Many people love that we get to experience 4 beautiful seasons & with that all of the exciting events both big & small. \n\nThe downtown, is truly the heart of Spokane, decorated with a beautiful river that runs through the center of our city. Riverfront Park is a highlight, home to our clock tower, pavilion, & outdoor events. It practically hugs River Park Square another one of my favorite places. \n\nWoven all through Spokane are the passionate small businesses that keep our city going. I adore the local restaurants, & the cozy coffee shops speckled throughout our city. Most of all, I love the kind people in our community!",

Everyone of different cultural backgrounds can feel included due to the city's diversity. Now Fremont is populated so there is the look out for traffic and compacted designated areas. Overall, the people are friendly and helpful when it comes to hospitality. However, not everyone will treat others as such so of course one has to be aware of those individuals. As far as the scenery, Fremont really is a sight to see! Its beautiful landscape captures one's attention. Great, ginormous mountains roam in the city's background as a painting on a wall. Fremont's mountains is used as a great backdrop for man selfies and group pictures that many often take of. Every now and then cattle will roam free on the mountains when you see from a distance. Fremont is a nice city for a newcomers.  The city is very welcoming to visit.",

It has a bigger population with much more traffic and housing developments meaning a competitive housing market. You definitely need to make good money to purchase at this time. That being said this city is a great place to raise kids and has lots of parks, trails, and a good school system. It is very diverse here, as a minority and a woman I can say I feel generally safe here. Lots of great authentic ethnic food here as well. There is a Kaiser/hospitals and plazas/hubs with lots of grocery options such as Trader Joes, Sprouts, FoodMaxx, and Ranch 99. Bike friendly but public transportation is not the best. There are many homeless here, just like the Bay Area in general, but it is not as bad as San Jose or SF. BART is a different story though!",

However, the city has become extremely urbanized and gentrified over the years. It more similarly has narrow roads like that of Oakland. The traffic has become congested and their has been a mass increase in the building of town houses and apartments on tiny plots of land for extremely expensive. Homeless has gone up too however it is a beautiful city and there's no where better to live than the Bay Area/ California!",

It is home to multiple universities, including Virginia Commonwealth University and The University of Richmond. Best of all, even after COVID, it's a terrific town to eat and drink your way through. RVA is home to over 30 craft brewers, with more on the way. Don't overlook the RVA Beer Trail! There are also various vineyards and cideries to visit. I've spent the majority of my life in Virginia, and more than half of it in Richmond. I've gone around the world and seen many different places, yet Richmond stands out.",

Richmond itself has a flair for history, community, and outdoors. There are a plethora of hiking trails alongside the river as well as in the bustling city that take you through scenic views and rich history of the city. The restaurants themselves cater to various people. For example, I am vegan and there are many options for me to experience different food. People who live in Richmond are incredibly open to experiencing the world to the fullest. There are concerts both outdoors and indoors nearly every night, and there never is a shortage of festivals and events to keep everyone excited for more to come. Richmond, Virginia is and always will be home.",

There is almost always something to do on any given day of the week, and if you are into trying new restaurants and bars you are guaranteed to have countless new places to try. One of my favorite things about Richmond is that it offers a mixture of urban life and active outdoors life. Being a \"River City,\" Richmond has many relaxes spots where you can sit on some boulders and enjoy the sound of the rushing water. One of my favorite things to do in the summer time is to get a group of friends together and go tubing down the river! We rope our tubes together, bring an extra tube to hold the cooler full of drinks and snacks, and just float and chill. Another thing that I love about Richmond, is that although the city is small and easy to get around, the different neighborhoods are so diverse! You will definitely get a taste of several aesthetics while exploring Richmond.",

For example, I had to petition that an African American studies course be added at College of the Canyons. I think there's a difference between me enjoying the nature and the people who live here.  I live on a gorgeous hillside where you can fall in love with the simple plumps of snow on the mountains in the background. However, when I walk into a store, I always feel like I'm being watched because I'm black. One time I was accused of stealing a gift at Target that I preordered. It was my nephews Christmas gift and instead of apologizing , the person just walked off.  So there's often a low level of racial profiling depending on the store you go to.  Furthermore, there's a sense of ignorance or  unintentional racism in the older part of Santa Clarita aka New Hall.  There is a restaurant called the EGG Plantation which makes me  feel undeniably uncomfortable",

I've read that the city was founded by Mormon church members and that they still control the politics. Lots of cops move here and that's good, but they also bring an \"Us vs. Them\" mindset too, and that's not good. Lots of people here are living paycheck-to-paycheck but think they're somehow \"elite\" and look down on nearby places like Palmdale, San Fernando, Fillmore, Lancaster while conveniently not mentioning that they have zoned out people they deem \"undesirable\".

However, there are places that are filled with tranquility, numerous of job opportunities, healthy living, and good nightlife. One thing I really enjoy about San Bernardino is that there is this organization that assists in serving the poor and homeless, often giving out food, water, and even some shelter places in order for the homeless to live better. Nevertheless, there are many schools that reside in gang affiliated areas, which I think should be changed in order to provide safer school environments to students. I began actually living in the area this year, but have been around the area for years now, and if you want to visit an area where the community helps each other out in many ways regardless of wealth, visit San Bernardino.",

San Bernardino is slowly growing and constantly striving to be a better city and over the years it has been very evident that the community is changing for the better.

LSU brings so much life to the fall weekends with football games that take over the town! If you aren't lucky enough to snag tickets, you can go to any restaurant and feel like you are in Tiger Stadium. You are close enough for a day hop to Lafayette or New Orleans for soul satisfying Cajun or jazz music and delicious comfort food.

Not much to do besides going out to eat but everything else in South Florida is easily accessible from Hialeah.",

However, the city is slowly deteriorating due to its residence and how much carelessness and lack of pride Tacomans have. People are always upset, inconsiderate, violent, have very poor work ethic, slow, and just plain old depressed. These poor qualities in the people therefore impact the city's infrastructure and culture, the infamous \"grit city\" is coined. The only good aspect about Tacoma is their waterfront. It seems people are content with living in subpar conditions and show little to no effort in improvement.",

Super easy to get around on a bike, stroll past historic and colorful craftsman houses, 10 minute walk (for me) to 6th Ave, short bike ride to Proctor. Tacoma rocks excellent and affordable restaurants, museums, music and comedy venues, and incredible parks! Transportation is improving year by year with major upgrades to public transportation, rail access to Seattle,  etc.",

The old-mixed-with-the-new culture in Downtown is refreshing and fun, and the art scattered around the city is always breathtaking. Other parts of Tacoma are also lovely, with delicious restaurants with a wide variety of cuisines, homey residential areas and gorgeous parks. All around, Tacoma is amazing!",

There aren't many sky scrapers, but there are restaurants and shopping centers as far as the eye can see! You won't need to travel far to your favorite restaurant or clothing store. Our downtown area is becoming more urban and art-forward, with the addition of the Gallo Center and several art galleries. The weather is generally predictable and calm. Most of the year is sunny and comfortable, with only a few drizzly months during winter. The central valley is typically free from natural disasters, and overall, a comfortable place to live. The only drawbacks are the people. This is a largely agricultural, meaning conservative, region. I wish we would adopt big a big city mentality to match the landscape!",

There are a lot of restaurants and the cost of living here is lower than in neighboring areas. However, one of the biggest downsides of living in Modesto is the crime rate and poverty.

There are great people in this town and lifelong friends to be made. Some parts of the town are better than others but the best part about Modesto is that a lot of people in this town have started from the bottom up and have thriving local businesses such as the Gallo winery. Modesto is also close to a lot of other attraction sites so you are never far from missing out on all the fun!

During the snow bird months it does get a little busy with traffic but that's ok.  Local contractors are great!  We use bestchoicelawnserviceportsaintlucie.com for our lawn guys.  They are super helpful and trustworthy!  Come check out all that PSL has for you!",

Port St Lucie is a great family friendly place to live. We don't have many crimes that are reported and for the most part pretty friendly neighbors. This area is also very affordable with minimum night life. If your looking for a quiet and friendly environment to raise your children, then Port St Lucie is the place for you!",

The large amount of fast food places that also surround the town. We do not have any local tasty cooking places around here, mostly chain restaurants or fast food joints. It would be nice to see something new be built, instead of another Burger King.. Also, there is absolutely no night life here at all. Most places are closed by 10 pm. Also, why don't we have a whole foods grocery store or trader joe's?!?!? Dying to have one of those around here!",

The are plenty of caves, trails, and rivers to explore. As things have started to open back up, there have been many additions added to the city. We are getting a AA baseball team, restaurants and hotels continue to open everyday, and there are social distanced events that happen throughout the city such as music venues showing free local artists. The food scene is on the rise with classic southern food, the integration of food trucks/trailers, and even European inspired food is starting to show up. I like that Huntsville has diverse culture and is a very transient city. You never know who you will meet and hear the stories of how we all ended up in town!",

Some people are very rude and will stare you down. It's really creepy. Bridge Street is really nice, but the downtown needs some (a lot of) renovations. Basically just two parks and three restaurants. There is a lot to do, you just need to go out of your way to find it. I am looking forward to the downtown renovations. The jobs here are nice, with a growing tech industry. Madison has more things to do than Huntsville (sadly). Huntsville has problems, but I think someday will rival Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, etc. I hope my review helped you. Note: House prices are growing 8% every year. Now's the time to buy!",

Corporations like engineer-generating NASA and security-enforcing Redstone Arsenal are located right here in Huntsville, promoting impressive technological advancements and safety being of the upmost importance, not to mention the often “Hello!” and friendly wave! The one thing that would enhance Huntsville is more businesses and people living here. The real-estate is fantastic, with low-cost houses, acres of land, safe neighborhoods, academically rated schools and more! If one was to look for an amazing place for friends and family, exciting innovation and academic superiority, an outpouring of creative art, historical sites, beautiful landscapes, farmer-fresh foods, wide-open spaces, crime free zones, and a breath of fresh air, Huntsville is the place to be!",

I have moved 3 times in these three years. It is also a great place for people raised in small towns to go out and ease themselves into a city life. It is a good place to learn about other people and their walks of life too! I scored affordability low because it is harder to pay for living for younger adults, especially if you don't have roomates.",

First, the good things:\n\nBike Paths: There are over 2000 miles of biking trails, and they're all excellent.\n\nThe People: They are very nice people. Everyone smiles and waves at you. I've only meet a handful of rude people.\n\nFood: There are endless places for any kind of food here and they're all excellent.\n\nNow the bad things:\n\nThe winter: This is the number one worst thing about Iowa in general and the reason I'm leaving. You will see sub-zero F temperatures regularly in the winter, and it's fairly cold out for at least 5 months of the year.\n\nHousing: It is not as cheap here as you might think, houses in the suburbs are expensive. Houses in the city limits are cheap, but they are very small and very close together.\n\nOutdoors: This was a big disappointment for me. There are some 'parks' here, but they're typically just a few trees and a playground. There are not many opportunities for hiking or backpacking.",

I'm about to hit 5 years here on August 4th, and I've gone through a lot of things here both good and bad. When it comes to wanting a life that is much more simple, quieter and a place with an average cost of living then Iowa is actually nice! I like the people here and DUE to the people here I was able to calm down from being the very hostile New Yorker to a very friendly 'Iowan'... it's nice, if I can say so myself. There's quite a lot of grass and country type of ordeals that makes going outside a lot more fun and enjoyable if you like nature as well! Des Moines is also expanding slowly so there's always new stuff that comes! And it is also small enough where they have this thing called the Iowa State Fair, it's pretty dope. Overall, Des Moines is pretty nice - sometimes it's still odd that I actually live here now, but I do, and I will make the best of it like I been doing for the past five years.",

I came across this Riverside’s rich history is on display during a walk-through downtown. \nJust reading and writing about downtown Riverside brings me back to my childhood! Holiday memories, school friends, fun, food, my family history and the many people who have come and gone since then. Also, how far I’ve come in my life.

I just wish the council focused on more ethical and environmental decisions to help out the city. My experience would be better if there were more than just parks for environment establishments that we can have. Maybe a small shop with refillable products like soap, for example.

The city has partnered up with other programs/organizations to address those experiencing homelessness. Our police department has created a team that specifically interacts with the homeless population. Funding is provided to our city for providing these kinds of programs which is also thanks to our mayor.\n\nFontana is currently working on approving a grant that would aid in the development of housing for our homeless population. The winds are strong and crazy when they come around but they make life exciting. \n\nI love that we are near the mountains and the hills we have around us make for a delightful twilight, sunset and sunrise.",

Though I dislike the lack off attention the city gives to the issues of bullying in their school district. Bullies get away scotch free as the victims have to suffer in silence. The city also seems to be more interested in money than it is in helping its residents. For example, off of baseline they have erected warehouses that will pay the city rent while appearing to infest the city with more smog. They also cut corners installing pvc watermains when they came to replace the main on the homeowners side so that they will have to pay more money when the watermain inevitably breaks due to the pressure. My father saw this and when he asked why there was galvanized metal on the city's side ( towards the middle of the street) and the property owners' side (towards the residence in question) the workers responded that it was cheaper for the city. This is only some of the problems with the city.",

Schools are average on education but the kids today are very disrespectful. North Fontana is better than south Fontana, nicer people and schools.",

And Frisco isn't just a suburb — it's a beloved city unto itself. They developed an area with necessary locations like supermarkets and gas stations within a short distance from each other. Although the zoning for schools is strangely designed, it offers a lot of opportunities for students not found in many places. There are a few signs of pollution, and there are many parks and nature locations to visit. Residents often live in Frisco for a long time due to the comfortable distance between the city and the benefits of living in a suburban area. Many major companies have locations here and give residents access to their special facilities.I like the diversity and friendly community I've interacted with during my time in Frisco. I appreciate the feeling of safety in most areas of Frisco along with the high-quality educational facilities.",

You can feel completely safe traveling in this city at night as the Frisco PD is amazing. There is such a community atmosphere here and the neighbors are extremely kind.

There are a variety opportunities here, and lots of foods to try! Rochester is named as one of the best foodie places. Theres also always something going on, whether you're more into a chill, relaxing time or a night out. If you're interested in it, theres a good chance you'll find some event related to it in Rochester. My favorite is the public market on the weekends; there is such great produce for super cheap, and you can taste how much better it is than getting it at the grocery store. From food trucks to the lilac festival to baseball games, Rochester has it all. You just have to explore online for these things. Rochester is also a great location for other cities; we are only 3 hours from Toronto and an hour from Buffalo, another great foodie town!",

I also really love all of the food options, they have quite a few places for vegans and quite a few places for people who consume other diets as well. The winters here are a bit harsh which is why I am giving Rochester 4 stars but in the spring it transforms into this paradise that you never want to leave. The smell of the lilacs is to die for and they tend to have a few different festivals and events for people all over Rochester to enjoy, such as the lilac festival, the corn hill arts festivals and many more.",

There are plenty of opportunities to volunteer, get involved with community advocacy work, and enjoy the natural beauty the region offers!",

There are plenty of hiking trails and with the mountains just an hour or so away that is also an option! If you like museums there are plenty near Fort Bragg! You learn about the history of our military and the planes that were used. My husband and I try to stay very active and there is ALWAYS something to do! On date nights we have a large amount of restaurants to chose from. Our favorite so far is Bubba's! There are also bubble tea spots. I have never had it before and it is honestly amazing.",

The city of Fayetteville is great for those who are connected to the military in some way, and for those who are dedicated to serving active-duty and veteran service members. With Fort Bragg being here, there are many different types of people that live here, from all walks of life! You are bound to find people that share similar beliefs, values, and interests as you--if you are willing to look. The city is currently under a bit of construction because of the growing number of people that are moving here, which makes for a longer commute time. It is very family-friendly, and the city is a decent distance from the capital, Raleigh. Additionally, Fayetteville is a short distance away from the mountains and from the beaches.",

A family member who grew up here and moved couldn’t even recognize downtown just after a few years! Another thing that has brought the city together is that we are going to host the Boston Red Sox affiliate team called the WooSox. Everything about this upcoming organization just screams Worcester. The new stadium is named after the Worcester-based beverage company, Polar! The city is very diverse and offers many opportunities for people living here. There are many free parks, restaurants(check out Shrewsbury Street for some amazing Italian food), and the new Public Market recently opened which is amazing and offers a lot to do in one building. I am currently in the public school system and I’ve had a great experience and had many unique learning opportunities. Worcester is a big city with an even bigger heart.",

I grew up dirt poor, didn't have the cool and flashy clothes to wear to school. Living here gave my parents the opportunity to find jobs without a high form of education. After living more than half of my life in thrift store and hand-me-downs, my family is at a good place right now in regards to financially. I love it here! The neighborhoods here could be a bit scary, but I met some of the greatest people here. It's my home, I wouldn't be anywhere else but Worcester.",

The lack of mufflers on many trucks, cars and especially motorcycles makes the streets very noisy and the city police don’t seem to care whatsoever. If you live on any type of waterway you’ll certainly find a vacation rental close where there’s a new exceptionally loud party starting each and every Friday night. The vacation rentals are ruining this community. The unregulated noise, traffic, hit and runs and vacation rentals has forced us to sell our lovely home. There’s nearly a traffic accident on a daily basis with many hit and runs or vehicles ending up in a canal. Speed is the culprit but speed limits are voluntary throughout most of the Cape. The local news reported on average 100,000 hit and runs a year average over the past several years. You’ve been warned!",

IF you do buy a home UP here and the city comes to put you on water/sewer, you'll get slapped with a huge property tax assessment to foot the bill.\n\nDon't let Cape Coral's proximity to Fort Myers mislead you.  For the most part, the two couldn't be more different.   Cape Coral grows by a \"lot and block\" home building pattern that many SW FL residential areas are experiencing.  By code, with some exceptions, most homes are on 1/4 acre lots.  But much of Northern Cape Coral is empty lots and few trees.  Flat.  Barren.  If lush, aged, tree growth is what you seek, look elsewhere, like Ft Myers.\n\nOh and the ATVs driving up and down the streets!  Fun fun!",

Compared to the city, McKinney has clean streets, good roads, and plenty of walking trails. \nThe people here are much friendlier too! McKinney is relatively a safe place to live. Of course, in my household we lock our cars and our house before we leave. However, as a young woman I feel comfortable talking a walk outside or going to the mall by myself. I actually think I enjoyed going to school in McKinney. I had many great teachers that have taught me more than just passing an exam and along the way I’ve made lifelong friendships. The only disadvantage is that during the summer, especially in July and August it gets pretty hot here. According to my research, our temperatures can go as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit. However, when the weather is nice like most days there are many dog parks for outdoor activities, playgrounds for children, strip malls, and cinemas around the area!",

I would proudly give this place a four out five stars for its high quality safety, job opportunities, nightlife, and diversity. I moved to McKinney, Texas over a year ago from a small town in Connecticut called Farmington. It was a drastic upgrade and I adapted to the Texan lifestyle quickly. McKinney was the perfect area to live in for me because it wasn't inside the city, nor was it in the country. I felt very safe here, even at nights where I could walk outside and not have to worry about being followed. There were high security systems, and it was very family friendly with plenty of daycare and parks for younger children. Unfortunately, I live right on the borderline of McKinney and Melissa, so I somehow fit onto Melissa ISD, and I wasn't able to experience any of the McKinney public schools. To add on, there was heavy diversity which was something I loved unlike my own town!",

It is definitely more diverse in some areas compared to others, but my neighborhood is very white. But in other parts of town, McKinney has a significant low-income population, many of which are Hispanic. \n\nHowever, it is a beautiful suburb, with many trees. There are nature trails, lakes, parks, and much more. We have everything a suburb could need. We have three high schools, five middle schools, and many elementary schools, at least one of which is primarily for bilingual spanish/english children. It is very family-friendly, I've never seen any instance of crime, and is pretty ethnically diverse. I assume that unless you're a teenager, finding other queer adults would be difficult.  If you are driving to Dallas for work, a minimum 30 minute drive is necessary, thought many others work in town.",

It is also one of the most affordable states in which to live. The economy is strong and diverse with numerous job opportunities. The schools are good and the state truly promotes the arts. Whether you’re looking for a job or a rewarding volunteer opportunity, Arkansas has much to offer. As greater Little Rock, Texarkana, northeast and northwest Arkansas continue to grow, professionals are needed to fill positions in fields ranging from technology and agriculture to teaching and sale.",

There's a good deal of this or that for everyone and crime is not too bad. The education system is pretty diverse and kids here enjoy going to school about as much as children living anywhere else would. For the most part, I've seen tremendous  growth in almost every aspect of the city. From newly paved highways to one of the best hospitals in the country and even electing its first African-American mayor, Little Rock is thriving and well. It's central location makes it minutes away from everything beautiful and grand that the state of Arkansas has to offer.  I've visited the landmark Central High School and the Clinton Presidential Center Library numerous times. History and nature are abundant and worth every bit of their unique value. Nowhere's perfect but, trust me, Little is close!",

The main split is racial, but also very economic. Due to wild gang violence in the 1970s and racial issues before that, the city is prone to narrow-minds and crime-ridden neighborhoods. Newcomers can have a hard time fitting in (my parents from Texas and Wisconsin) and it's easier to settle if you join clubs, groups, and churches. The trick is getting past the clan mentality. \nThe good part: private schools, child-programs, and NHAs are huge here. Communities stick together and it's a beautiful city. That's not even going into cost of living. \nIf you want a diverse city to raise your family, we're a pretty good place.",

Local Seabees, students, and a great mixture of general public make up this diverse city.  What I would like to see improve in Oxnard is the condition of roads and streets.  The main roads got replaced but many side streets need a lot of repairs.  The sales tax is okay compared to neighboring cities.  This famous city is home to the Strawberry Festival.  Nearby  is a government center and San Buenaventura mission.  \nI earned my Associate of Science in Business Administration from Oxnard College & transferred to CSU Channel Islands nearby.  The actual islands are only 5-6 miles off the coast.  This is a great area to live.  The residents of Oxnard, Ventura County, California are truly fortunate to have so much within close proximity.",

Oxnard has many landmarks that people can visit. The city is filled with lifeful people that can make the city seem much more livelier than it can be at times, in which the city is already very alive. The city has a reputation of being unsafe, but that is simply not true for every area of the city. The city is filled with rural areas and can be acknowledged in every direction. Farms are filled with crops and it is notable that there is very good productions of goods such as food and consumer products. To conclude, Oxnard is filled with a diverse community that provide for the city in more ways than one.",

As someone who has lived here for most of their life, its none of those things. Oxnard, even though it has its faults, its filled with spirit and culture. Many different cultures and people get together and bond here, whether its when there's a car show on Sunday or when there's a festival celebrating a holiday. Oxnard is a beautiful town with beaches all around and beautiful sunsets/sunrises. The people here are kind and the restaurants have delectable food, especially the Mexican style ones. The town does have some faults, but there's nowhere else I would rather live than in Oxnard.",

Do not move here if you are a liberal (I would consider myself more left-leaning as a younger person) because you'll hate it. Don't move here if you like nice weather or pretty scenery. And don't move here if you want a vibrant, busy, walkable city.

In addition to meeting so many of my friends here, it's also near quite a few big cities like Columbia, SC, and Atlanta. It's a great place for tourists and locals, as Masters weekend has allowed small businesses to flourish, even through the pandemic. 10/10 would recommend visiting - or ever living! - here.",

There is not a lot for middle aged to do since the younger crowd take over the bars and clubs and get out of control and fight and shoot. The best area to live is north or west side. Stay far from the south side there is alot of break ins, shooting, and gang members watching you. It's best you live in Augusta get you some surveillance cameras, plenty of lights outside, and alarm on your vehicle and keep people out of your business. The Masters shouldn't be the only highlight of Augusta or the hi end Mall. Augusta needs a zoo, a aquarium, more sophisticated bars for the older crowd 40 and up not just cater to 20 something crowd. Augusta need to stop planning to plant so many trees it's just a big mold and mildew problem for home owners and the air quality in this city. Augusta needs alot of improvement especially all the closed down buildings downtown Augusta makes the downtown look bad. Goodness Augusta folks wake the hell up!",

The nightlife is ok but has taken a dive since Covid. New bars, restaurants and entertainment were opening up before and now a lot of the staples are actually closing. The west side and downtown are in the middle of a gentrification battle. The winters are ok, but pretty cold, whereas the summers are hotter than ever. I wouldn’t suggest getting an apartment without AC unless you live in a basement. Great outdoors activities though! Head to the mountains to escape what’s surprisingly REALLY bad pollution that gets trapped over the city, aka “The Inversion.”",

Summer is a blast with hiking, mountain biking, camping, water sports. There are a ton of lakes within 30 minutes of downtown with camping, fishing and boating options. Southern Utah is red-rock country, and only 3-5 hours away from downtown, depending on which direction you go.  The city itself is very conservative, but that just makes the more liberal folks try harder to push back. The art and music scenes are awesome, and believe it or not, we have great beer, wine and spirits made right in our city. There are a ton of bars and clubs, theaters and a large amusement park 25 minutes from downtown.",

As a student at the University of Utah, I find it so easy to hop on Trax or take the bus to get around town for groceries, to City Creek Mall, or even to one of the many ski resorts nearby! My personal favorite is Brighton! Salt Lake so far has been such an amazing place to live, with so many great places to eat and try new food, all kinds of cool coffee shops, and so much accessible outdoor adventures, like hiking and snowboarding. I absolutely love it here and would recommend that anyone come at least check it out!",

          "body": "Overall I really love living here in Montgomery! The job and real-estate market have always been strong here, with fun things around town and the diversity of people who live here. Cost of living is very affordable and the growth throughout this city is really impressive. That being said I believe  Montgomery really has only two main factors holding it back, crime and public schools. Although the magnet and private schools here are fantastic, the average public schools are often lacking in maintenance and kids can fall behind. As of recently, however (early 2022) things have been turning around in the school system for the better which is good to see. Lastly is crime, as most places around  Montgomery are great safe places to live, however some parts of the southern areas of the city and the west side are plagued with property and sometimes violent crime. Overall the MPD has done a good job keeping these incidents down, but crime continues to be one of Montgomery's lingering issues.",

The downtown area has a great amount of history.  There are many museums, monuments, and historical sites that are informative of the African American history.  There are so many hometown restaurants with great food!  Montgomery is a great city to start businesses and thrive.  There are many areas for night life for all ages.  I was able to continue my education here at an. affordable university.  Housing is cheaper than any other place that I have ever lived.  Montgomery is central to several surrounding major cities.  It is one hour from Birmingham, Alabama, two hours from Atlanta, Georgia, four hours from Nashville, Tennessee, and only a two hour drive to beaches in Florida.  Overall, I have enjoyed my stay here and would recommend everyone to visit at least once.",

There is a church on almost every corner, and so many denominations are represented in Montgomery.",

However, through it all, the citizens of Birmingham remained strong and steadfast. The love that we all have for each other is amazing.  We have an amazing mayor, Mayor Randall Woodfin, who is out in our neighborhoods and communities making a difference everyday. He is very smart and he thinks about the whole city of Birmingham, no matter the race and/or ethnicity. This is what we desperately need right now in this world. People are torn apart and we should all be standing and working together to ensure success for everyone. It breaks my heart when I'm driving and I see homeless people or people in need. Birmingham has helped so much with this by opening warming stations, homeless shelters, public shower facilities, community kitchens, food drives, and so much more. I make it my duty to donate to these causes because Birmingham is my home too.",

Five Points South is the only place you need to go for nightlife, but don't be afraid to keep exploring! There's cute little deli places and hole in the wall coffee shops that will keep you running all through the long workday. I do wish there were more accessible public libraries, but as a student, I'm blessed to be able to use UAB's library system (which has more than enough books to satisfy my bookish tendencies). Sometimes parking can be a hassle, though, so remember to always keep some spare change for the parking meters when traveling downtown.",

With the blue bridge lights, to people strolling through Rosa park circle, not to mention you might hear a concert or event down the way at Van Andel. It’s a very business, and family friendly place to start at. Even the options for college in the area are great! The school system well not so much. It definitely needs more improvement. Luckily there are top school of choice charter schools in or near the area that are tuition free! Housing and food seem to be affordable with the right job and nice in certain spots. Personally GR is perfect for a independent city person who’s ready for that busy loud life.",

We offer MANY educational/trade schools and career options as well for those seeking to go to higher places. I'd also dare say, it's a great place to raise a family! Plenty of diversity all around as far as the different walks of life, which is a great thing in my opinion!\n\nGrand Rapids  comes from OLD money, but with it QUICKLY becoming the fastest growing smallest city in the US, our YOUNGER people are bringing in a dose of fresh air. A mix bag of Rep & Dem./Lib. views.\n\nI just wish the real estate, rent, & cost of living were more affordable.",

Overland Park is apart of Kansas City, which is known for their barbecue.  Because Overland Park is centralized, it is near downtown KC and other downtown areas.  With lots of new land open for building, you can be apart of either a new or older neighborhood.  Its a growing city with lots of opportunities to have fun, relax, and get out!",

There is literally something for everyone to do and enjoy here which is why I love it so much. There are plenty of national parks, reservation land, and outdoor activities for families to enjoy, while Tallahassee arguably also has some of the best night life and party scene around, with Florida State consistently being ranked the #2 party school in the nation. Everything is pretty close geographically which makes it fairly easy to get around, and summers are nice and quiet because all of the students are back home. It really does not get better than Tally!",

College Town is close to the universities but also where many government jobs are located. Traffic can be horrible as many people seem not to know or care to follow basic traffic rules (no turn signal, not moving over for merging traffic, extremely slow and also extremely aggressive drivers, etc). This is the case despite which area you're driving in. There are TONS of restaurants. Several nice parks as well. North side and South near (Southwood) areas are nice for families but can be high priced with small lots. There is a lot of political corruption with schools, universities, and big businesses. Most people are friendly in person. Jobs tend to be around Gov, Universities, then Healthcare. Some very nice schools and not so great ones. Crime is high. High cost of living. Plenty to do but HOT. Weather sucks! Very diverse.",

Tallahassee is the Capital of Florida and a college town, so it has a rich mix of culture, nightlife, and food. Our city is very family-friendly with festivals, great schools, and gorgeous parks. We're located about two hours from the beach, four hours from Disney, and just a quick drive away from Georgia. Residents and visitors alike enjoy access to a variety of activities such as mountain biking, hiking, swimming, and boating in and around Tallahassee. Our town is renowned for our canopy-covered roads, a rich variety of wildlife, and activities for all walks of life.",

There’s also a huge homeless population here and everything is dirty.  There’s so much construction going on all the time it feels like you can never drive anywhere without your route somehow being redirected. I really don’t get how people can love it here. You spend so much money for the smallest apartment and you spend your time stuck in traffic because it’s so far from any freeway.

Growing up, there wasn’t a lot of activities in comparison to other places I lived. However, it’s way more family oriented with the way jobs pay fairly, rent is cheap,  and strong neighborly bonds.  What I feel it could work on the most is having more child friendly activities that don’t cost an arm and a leg like the sprinkler park they have.  All in all, I love the town I grew up in and hope it continues to improve its values, communities, and lifestyles. Thank you!",

My neighbours are also wonderful people. Due to covid, finding outdoor activities, such as playing sports, in nature has been the most important and useful for both me and my family's mental health. The traffic here is usually light compare to Los Angeles where I used to live. Peoria has a family-oriented and relaxing environment. In terms of public transportation, Peoria does not have the greatest options. I have only seen a couple of metro stops and buses here as compared to LA. The weather here is quite hot and humid, especially during summer times, but what I do like about the seasons here is that you do have the option to go see some beautiful and the most perfect snow only 2 hours away in Flagstaff. It also hails sometimes here during the winter season. Overall, I would recommend anyone to visit this city if possible!",

I think there are many educational opportunities because of Knoxville great schools around town and a university in the middle of downtown Knoxville. I also think there is always something to do! There are always new pop ups or small businesses opening up around town, and many beautiful parks or places with a great view of the city. Along with that I feel a sense of safety and community in Knoxville. Everything is well kept, landscaped, and clean as well as the many safe neighborhoods that are available all over the city.

It is a bit older looking than Farragut or Sequoyah Hills but nonetheless an amazing place to grow up. I am enrolled in a private school on the other side of town that I simply adore. We have small class sizes and a beautiful campus. I did in fact go to a public elementary school that I loved just the same. My elementary school was large and loving.

The simple part about home market, jobs, commute times, health, and living are relatively normal across the board since it is a suburb.  To my knowledge, it isn't overly expensive, and there is a diverse population of people for many outlooks on a single topic.  Now, the border state and \"things\";  the nightlife is few and far between since I have little interest in that area, there is a presence (not strong, but one that's there) of human trafficking from the occasional bout on the news, lots of wrong-way drivers, and poor respect for the public school system.  Overall though, there are lots of good people that warm the heart.",

I feel like there always something I can do in my town and if there isn’t, I can always go to neighboring towns and there's always something to do. I loved growing up here and the people here. Sadly, the homeless is becoming more of a heavy problem in recent years but you can find good schools in the area and the people have always been great in my experience!",

People here are friendly and enjoy numerous outdoor activities - like walking or biking along the riverfront, hiking the nearby trails to the east, swimming and kayaking in local rivers and streams. \n\nThere are many parks, although there is room for more with all the new housing that has been built in the last 10 years. Many schools have remodeled or rebuilt. There are lots of sports activities for the kids, like soccer, basketball, rugby and lacrosse. There are sports leagues for adults, too, like disc golf, basketball, and ultimate frisbee.\n\nWe have a wide variety of restaurants with dishes from all over the world. You can find something for any size budget. My favorites are Thai Orchid and Feral Public House in downtown Vancouver for a special occasion. Mon Ami is another favorite for delicious crepes and Stumptown coffee.\n\nVancouver is great for families!",

Vancouver has been booming that past few years with construction and people moving here. I think the reason many people move to this area is because it is beautiful and affordable, if you have a decent job. Vancouver used to have more of a country feel and the population was not that big. But times have changed, and I would call it a very busy suburb. If you drive 20 minutes you can get to Portland Oregon where you will experience some city life. In Portland there seems to be more diversity than in Vancouver. Overall, I would love to see more diversity in the Pacific Northwest. The majority of the population is white/caucasian. The schools I went to were not very diverse either. Diversity is something I really appreciate and wish for Vancouver to have more of. Otherwise, I really enjoy living in Vancouver Washington!",

While the Akron city school district is not the best, many of the suburbs have great public school systems (such as Revere) and are very close to private school systems (such as Our Lady of the Elms). Akron is quite artsy and there is so much to do downtown. For instance, during the summer there is a yoga festival that happens at Locke 3 (right downtown) and during the winter that same spot has ice skating under Christmas lights. There is also so very many coffee shops, restaurants, and bars that are only found in Akron. My favorite coffee shop is Nervous Dog :)  Another part of Akron that is absolutely amazing is the Highland Square area. Highland Square is home to a one-room movie theatre from the 1930s that serves alcohol!",

It seems like we all spend a lot of quality time with our family. Friends become family and gatherings are usually large and frequent. I rate it 4 starts because there is still plenty of room for improvement and growth. But this will always be home. There is a snack stand on every corner and always a taco place near by. The food here is the best! Although, we need more diversity because our food is basically Mexican, barbecue, tacos, and wings. I would like more parks and for the ones we do have to be maintained. It seems like the city builds something but doesn't keep up with maintenance all that well. A big pro is that you can get to any place in almost 10 minutes, commuting is fantastic.",

After wandering around and coexisting with the people here I find that it is extremely culture heavy. Wether it be in the down town area where local shops have an inviting atmosphere, to the surrounding neighborhoods. Brownsville borders Mexico and of course the culture mixes with the Americans. People here are passionate and very forward thinking. Slowly but surely the city is improving by fixing up old buildings while preserving Historical landmarks. One thing I would personally change is the speed bumps. They are old and very high. I scraped  the bottom of my car and I'm certain other have as well.",

Brownsville is known to be the poorest city in the United States of America, but it has its perks and national staples that make it monumental. It is known for the history that it holds, such as UTB/UTRGV (University of Texas at Brownsville/University of Texas Rio Grande Valley), that is known for being Fort Brown. Although it may be the poorest city in America, I feel that it has more to offer than just being \"poor\". There are opportunities to be found here for students and young adults, considering there is a UTRGV campus here, and there are opportunities to send students to the UTRGV Edinburg campus to help those students have a better future for themselves and their families. The life here is not as bad as people make it out to be, it is a historical city filled with opportunities that just need to be found and taken advantage of!",

Mobile has a program for fifty high school senior women to represent the city; the court of 2016-2017 was invited to the presidential inauguration. This court wears traditional antebellum dresses and broadcasts the history of Mobile. An example of the community in this town is the USS Alabama. The USS Alabama, known as the Battleship locally, is a World War II ship that was going to be retired and destroyed it not for a Mobilian boy. The boy sold tickets to raise money to bring the Battleship into Mobile's Bay, eventually succeeding! If you have a ticket stub from the fundraiser you get into the park free! I can not express my love for this town in under 1,000 characters, maybe you'll have to come to visit us for yourself.",

There is almost always something fun to do on the weekends in downtown or other areas and if not, you can always find a yummy bite to eat! You can't get enough of the warm weather either! We all show some form of our southern hospitality; comfort and joy are things we know best. I totally would suggest Mobile, Al being on your bucket list of travels!",

It was boring, and its only character traits were Mardi Gras and Moon Pies. I was ready for something bigger and better. Then four years later, Covid hit, and I graduated college, and my grandmother got sick, and there was no other choice but to come back to the city I was not fond of. I've been back in Mobile for about 10 months and my mindset has changed a lot since I was that 18-year-old itching to leave. Mobile is quirky. There are a lot of great places to eat at around here. There is a lot of history in this city. Like most places in the South, the people are pretty friendly. The beautiful azaleas bloom everywhere, and it even has Mardi Gras. Mobile may not seem like a big, exciting city, but it is home. And that in itself is exciting.",

The reason I have made the attempts to jump schools within my four years of high school is because I find the district , especially  high school's to be poor in communication as well as making sure students and family are well taken care of when it comes to records and academics . Although I am not as keen on the Newport News district I will say this is a relatively safe area to live . There are never too many reports about crime to my knowledge . There isn't much to do here as far as fun for families . There is a small city center that includes a movie theater , restaurants , a night view , as well as some hotels, and different small boutiques .It's known to be a quite town usually if you live here you travel to find something to do .It's known to be quite ,one plus from living in Newport News is you are close to Busch Gardens!",

          "body": "I like the area I live in (Hilton Village) for it's close community and proximity to other things to do, but overall Newport News is an awkward city and there's not a lot going on. It's very long and skinny (we really only have two main roads, and they run the whole peninsula) and downtown is really far away from a lot of the city! This can also be an issue with schools; I know kids who have an hour, two hour long bus ride. If you're considering moving here for a job opportunity, don't just look at any house within city limits; look for a house that's actually close to your job. Newport News is not walk-able and does not have good public transport, but considering Hampton Road's typical traffic, we don't have it too bad if you have a car. And, while it's not really a \"hip\" city, we're nearby a lot of tourist attractions, have great healthcare options, and you will be moderately comfortable here no matter your politics. I've lived here my whole life, and I'm happy with it.",

The most exciting part about Newport News to me is attending Open Mic Nights at the train station in downtown Newport News; Denbigh Day Parade for the students, and also being apart of a marching step team with my church House of Refuge Worship Center. People down here showcase their individuality. With the world being filled with hate and discrimination, Virginia is truly a place for lovers.",

I'm fortunate to attend my high school (CMHS) because of the opportunities I have there. Besides the three main high schools, people go to, there aren't many options where schools challenge you academically. Although I appreciate the variety of stores on Youree, there's honesty nothing here. There are a few events downtown sometimes. Overall I wouldn't recommend living here: gun violence, lack of activities, etc.",

Shreveport was a lively and exciting city when I was younger. As the years progressed, Shreveport slowly started dying. As in dying I mean mom and pop shops were closing due to running out of business, crime rate began to rise, racism started to exists more, and the education system is poor. I would like to point out that Louisiana is ranked the worst in crime and education as well which would make sense as to why many people are leaving Louisiana specifically Shreveport as the areas population is decreasing. However, Shreveport has amazing festivals such as Mardi Gras and I truly look forward to it every year. The restaurants are great and the food is divine. I would like the government to help make a change and to hopefully make Shreveport one of the best places to live in again. I want to see Shreveport to become lively again like I did in my childhood.",

The Red River Revel is a fun annual festival taking place downtown every autumn; we also have a huge fireworks spectacle to celebrate the 4th of July and great Mardi Gras parades during the winter. I was born and raised here and it is such a special city. There are many good public schools for pre-k through 12th grade.

Being born and raised in Soddy Daisy, a small country suburb about 30 minutes north of downtown, I would say I am pretty qualified to tell you anything and everything about this place! We are a fairly progressive city for being in the south. We have large hispanic, african american, lgbtq+, and more communities. Chattanooga is great in the fact that you still can get the small town feel, while not being far from the city. There is always something to do whether it is outdoor activities like hiking, kayaking, or swimming in mountain streams or the Tennessee River, or doing things like visiting the aquarium, attending a local sporting event, seeing a museum, or going to a shopping mall. Though I plan to leave soon, Chattanooga will always hold a piece of my heart. I absolutely plan to raise my children here in the future, you should too.",

It's a happy medium between a booming crowded tourist city like Nashville and a small town with nothing to do. It has the attractions and activities of a huge city, but with a lower cost of living and not as crowded. They have really renovated downtown into something really nice, and there's a lot of waterfront activities. Tons of hiking in the mountains surrounding the city and really nice scenery. Highly recommend for a weekend getaway, a whole vacation, or a relocation if you're looking for a new home!",

There are so many wonderful hiking trails with natural water features.  You can literally find it in this energetic town!",

This city also offers a very diverse community of people to interact with, allowing you to learn and understand many different cultures. There are many great public schools in Fort Lauderdale and respected colleges such as Nova Southeastern University or Broward College. In addition, there are so many fun activities one do in the area including but not limited to nearby beaches, art exhibits, a variety of great restaurants to dine in, yearly events to attend, as well as an exciting nightlife! Overall its family friendly and an exciting place to live, settle down, and enjoy life!",

          "body": "I moved from Brooklyn, NY to Fort Lauderdale, FL when I was 15 years old. As with most cities it has it good areas and its not so good areas. The public schools in the neighborhood if i may be honest are overcrowded. I wouldn't send my daughter to any of them. She attends a charter school. Nightlife is great, after all we are in south Florida so the nightlife is always Jumping! I would consider this city to be very kid friendly. Most neighborhoods here are pretty close knit. The city is very diverse and people from many different cultures also reside here. The Fort Lauderdale real market is currently a buyer's market. Very affordable to live here. There has been a lot of people moving here from Atlanta and NY due to the cost of living  being less expensive. I find fort lauderdale to be a great place to raise a child which is why im still here 15 years later. I love that people are friendly and helpful in most neighborhoods.",

Many great schools, public and private as well as many religious places to get involved in. I love Fort Lauderdale and am very grateful to have been raised here.",

Areas are very clean and maintained. I enjoyed the public schools here, even though the safety isn't the best in them. I wish mental health was advocated more all around, and wish they weren't so harsh and strict on students. Some rules have gotten very excessive. Otherwise they're great with student involvement, courses and events. There are activities around the area too but not many. There are sport leagues and clubs for young ones.Again, neighbors are friendly as their pets are very friendly as well. Overall Aurora's great if you get involved!",

It is also only a street away from Sacramento. Elk Grove is very diverse you will see people from all different races and backgrounds, and everyone is pretty accepting of the diversity in the community.

Going anywhere in Elk Grove is a pleasure with the wonderful people at every corner. Schools are the best here and as a student at Franklin High School, I’m extremely appreciative of this opportunities Elk Grove has given me. The only complaints I would have as a resident here are the roads. The city has been working extensively on roads recently, but on Kammerer Road, there are still many potholes. As a growing car enthusiast, potholes can be a disaster to a car’s suspension, and quite uncomfortable to drive on too. Other than that, I am very pleased with the new stores opening around South Elk Grove, which is where I live. My parents moved here from San Jose with me and my older brother about 15 years ago, and we visit family in San Jose often. The difference among this city and every other one is astonishing.",

Although there's many schools, restuarants, and places for religious worship, it's not that easy to get around. Most places require a car to reach the desired destination. Places often are not walking distance from residential areas, unless the desired destination is a park. There's also not many other local and fun activities for kids to do such as go to a museum or aquarium. But, there are arcades and bowling allies. The houses are a bit expensive, but not as expensive as you would find in Southern California.",

There is near-constant police activity and the homeless population can get aggressive depending on how many are in the neighborhood at one time. I generally go to the surrounding cities for recreational activities and for completing daily life tasks. The post offices near me are very inconsistent in their service, and the chain stores and food services are average at best. The small businesses here are wonderful, but seeing as I a don't have a lot of income and they need to compete with chain prices, I can't afford to support them all the time.",

Also, after the incident with the fireworks happened earlier this year, we just can’t see ourselves staying much longer. It doesn’t feel safe… Crime has gotten worse, the homelessness is also a rising issue as the city does not seem to care about helping those affected by this. Sometimes folks are nice.

Short commute times, as long as you don’t have to go over the bridge! Very large homeless population, with many seeming to have mental illnesses, and most refuse shelter opportunities. Politically, Salem as a whole leans conservative, but has a very liberal city council (unfortunately), which balances everything out. If you are considering moving to Oregon, I would definitely recommend Keizer, Springfield, or Eugene over Salem. Keizer and Springfield focus high quality communities, while maintaining a low cost of living. While Eugene, opposite of Salem, has forward thinking infrastructure projects, or existing high quality infrastructure. The Salem City Council voted against a new bridge to West Salem, against a new Costco Warehouse, and is hinting it will oppose commercial flights in the city’s airport.",

It is very family friendly, the town as a whole is a strong community especially since we have faced many crisis’ that have made our community strong and whole. The atmosphere is very welcoming and diverse which is why I love my town so much. With it being very into the wine culture, there’s many activities that are suitable for adults. For kids and teenagers there are many schools throughout the town that give incredible circulars and amazing sports teams. With many schools it creates high competition between the local school which make sports game very fun! Overall my experience with Santa Rosa is incredible, I was so blessed to have been raised here and could see myself easing my family here as well.",

I have a star for that.\n\nThis city used to have stagecoaches and the largest winery in the world used to be here, and the oldest one in California is too. This is where Route 66 meets the red cars/orange industry of the PE Trail and the Mojave Indian Trail that Jedidiah Smith took, helping to map the Oregon Trail! Without an internet search, you won't know that coming here - history isn't immersive, but covered up - some placards are even missing.",

It’s treated me well and I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon! Wish it was more affordable, but to get a good location in California, you have to cough up the money. It’s definitely worth it if you can afford it. There’s many restaurants, parks, shopping centers and malls in close proximity. Rancho always seems to be growing and expanding in terms of business and fun things for residents to do. I feel very safe in this community and have never experienced any crime. Hoping to buy a home here within the next few years. Overall, Rancho Cucamonga is where I’ve grown up and I’m proud to say that I live here.",

In the winter, the mountain is covered in sparkly white snow. There is an outside mall where everyone hangs out on warm Friday and Saturday nights called Victoria Gardens, which is well-known by all of the Inland Empire! If you don't want to go to Victoria Gardens, there are over 20 parks to choose from to have a picnic. Did I mention that Rancho Cucamonga grows the best grapes in California? Which is used to make the finest red wine ever, there is also a wine tasting room. All in all, Rancho Cucamonga is phenomenal and is known for its luxurious homes.",

Nobody bats an eye if someone walks down the street wearing fairy wings, goes to the store in their PJs, wears artistic makeup, or anything like that. People are friendly, approachable, and easy to get along with. There are a ton of good restaurants. One problem is that we have an extremely high rate of homelessness, and the city isn't handling it right (in my opinion). That being said, there are some great community organizations that help people in need as much as they can. Also, finding a place to live can be difficult for anyone, regardless of their income. If you don't apply for a property within a day or two of it being listed, you have no chance of getting it. Application fees are usually around $50. Property management companies also tend to take advantage of students who don't know their rights as tenants.",

I didn't really like how much it rained, but I suppose that's also what Eugene is known for. There're plenty of great food places around the city if you need a bite! For instance, grabbing an ice cream at Prince Puckler's, a pizza at TrackTown, or a crepe from one of the carts at the UO street fair. Overall, I would say that I am enjoying my experience in the city so far. It gives me a very homey feel and I am surprised by how easily I have created a lifelong group of friends within my university.",

People are great, crime low, less homeless than horrible Portland or even LA. Main problem: Cost of housing, gas, and horrible taxes-if you retire here, tax will tax all your income. This is a major reason everybody leaves and retires in Nevada, Tennessee, Florida or Texas. Poorly run state-Governor being recalled as we speak!",

Everything is pretty close, whether it's going to work or cheer practice or just out on a drive. the people here are pretty chill, and the surrounding cities are pretty fun too, such as Carlsbad, or Vista. I guess a couple things I would change would be maybe open up some more homeless shelters around the city, and provide food and clothes for them because I feel like there's nothing for them anymore. We are all in this pandemic together and I feel like as human to human we all need to work together and be nice to each other. Another thing I would change would to redo all the roads because the construction workers are constantly working underground. So what I mean is, like ripping up the perfect- good condition road, and doing construction, so there has been a whole lot of traffic lately. I know they can't control the road pavements, but thats what I would also change about the city. Overall the city of Oceanside is beautiful.",

There are high respects for military members, as it is also a military town due to the location of Fort Campbell Army base! Plenty of parks and trails to keep you busy outdoors, and many different types of indoor activities, like laser tag and mini golf, if you're an indoors type of person! We also have many art galleries and the Roxy that put on amazing shows. I would definitely recommend Clarksville as a place for people to visit.",

It offers affordable gas, apartments, houses, and a variety of foods. We also have some bars and two small clubs. Since it is close to a military base and a university, most of the customers are college students and Soldiers. If you need something bigger and louder, Nashville Broadway is only a 50-minute drive. Clarksville has family friendly centers like the arcade, movie theaters, shopping centers, parks, and etc.",

Being Vietnamese myself, I'm always greeted with nostalgia for my family's home cooked meals whenever I dine in a nearby restaurant or immerse myself in the crowds of people at the supermarkets who speak my parent's language. If anyone were to wonder what city would I recommend to visit surrounding the Orange County area, I'd recommend Garden Grove hands down! \n\nGarden Grove's signature dish that everyone flocks to is \"Pho Ga\", which translates to Pho Chicken. Pho can be regarded as the Asian Chicken Noodle soup, but better! \n\nWe pride ourselves on our culture too as we celebrate Chinese New Year every February with fireworks and firecrackers, leaving the streets reeking with smokes of good fortune yearly. \n\nAnd lastly, the homely feel that warms from this city. Nothing brings me more joy to see characteristics of my family in the everyday people that I bump into.",

You can grow tropicals in your garden.

Watch out for 40 mile per hour speed limits and red light cameras in some of the intersections.\n\nPeople here are friendly, and amenities conveniently close. (Gym, \nsupermarket, and post office.)  I do wish that there were more bike trails.  There are a ton of little public  parks and playgrounds everywhere.  Many of them do not have a restroom.\n\nI would give Garden Grove an overall 5 stars, except that the property taxes have gone up significantly since two school bond measures have passed.  I anticipate that the taxes will nearly double because of the way that the payouts are structured.",

Some of the positive aspect aspects of Garden Grove will be the teachers within our schools. While going to high school, many of teachers goes above and beyond to give their students the best learning experience they can possibly can. In addition, the teachers are not just like any other ordinary teacher. They would stay for hours after class and even sacrifice their time with their times just to help students like me. However, some negative aspects about our community is the treatment we give to one another based upon our different cultures and backgrounds. Many people in my community reacts to them first by their skin color before even knowing them. They do this by implicitly treating you different and by not showing signs of inclusions whatsoever. Overall, the problem with mistreatment towards others and the advantages of great teachers shows why I would rate my community as average.",

My neighborhood is moderately nice, it's very close to the  boulevard, which is a hub for events and people enjoy walking there with friends and family. Lots of restaurants, that's for sure, but as far as entertainment, there isn't much other than the movie theatres, restaurants, and bowling.",

There isn't much to do here if you don't go looking for things to participate in, but busier areas like Santa Clarita are not too long of a drive away. The people here are either really nice and laid back or unnecessarily rude and unfriendly. I feel confident enough to talk to employees in a store, but not as much to approach a random parent waiting for their child to get out of school. Many young people of color, as well as those in the LGBTQ+ community, say that they experience racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, etc. fairly often from other young people and older people. However, there are several community organizations that aid those in minority groups. COVID-19, the 2020 Election, and the BLM protests over the summer of 2020 highlighted a clear social and political divide among residents of the Antelope Valley. We also have a rising homeless epidemic as private resources are not enough to help unhoused people.",

Downtown has so many great things to see and many things to do.  Hammons Field is a great experience to see professional baseball, MediaCom Ice-park is also a wonderful option downtown, and the Gilloiz Theatre offers many great musicals, plays, and shows.  The one thing I wish Springfield would take time to improve is the drainage system.  It seems like every time it rains, the streets become majorly flooded and it becomes hard to control your vehicle.  Other than that, Springfield is a wonderful place to see, visit, and live!",

The aquarium addition definitely brings many the most profit to our area. Springfield also has many high schools and colleges that have great programs to continue our educations. I know this area like the back of my hand and really enjoy my stay here during college. It’s a best place to start fresh or to settle in for sure.",

Pembroke Pines provides its residents with many excellent public schools for children to attend, as well as outstanding public spaces including parks, libraries, and recreation centers. It is in a convenient location that allows for a reasonable commute to bigger cities nearby, including Fort Lauderdale and Miami.

We discovered this town when my husband and I were almost 60 and left a gorgeous place in Atlanta cuz this is easier living, with its smaller physical size and its longer range planning.  We  do errands by bike, enjoy friendly people & support successful non profits who care about those needing a hand. We residents work together to improve life.",

We have amazing community supported activities that happen all throughout the year including everything from races, to music, to culinary experiences, to college sports and more!  We are a friendly community that appreciates the culture and diversity Colorado State University brings.  We have tons of small businesses that our community avidly supports and large corporations that give back to enhance the place we call home. We love bikes, dogs and beer and we incorporate these three things into almost everything we do.  Our school district is strong and you can't make a bad choice for your kids whether they attend their neighborhood school or one of our several charter and private schools.  It's a great place to raise a family and a place those kids want to stay and raise their own families in.  Oh, and we have mountains and a huge reservoir in our backyard!",

We also have many parks and big open grassy spaces to meet with friends or just enjoy the sun. If that's not your thing, you can always go shopping in Old Town. \nIt's small enough that it's not difficult to get around, and there's not ever a lot of traffic, but it's big enough that it doesn't get boring too quickly.\nCons: \nWeather. The sun can get annoying. When it snows or rains, it's really exciting, and then before you can really appreciate it, it's gone. There's always a huge hail storm in May that destroys everything. It's really dry here, so it's difficult to grow plants. Also, if you don't take care of your hands they will crack from the dry weather.\nFort Collins isn't very diverse.\nIt's also very expensive to live here! Housing can get really expensive.\nBut overall, I love Fort Collins!",

Palmdale is a small town yet  filling up quickly as we improve to grow. Things I've noticed in East Palmdale is that its very quiet to start with; pretty peaceful from the beginning, its not common to have crime yet its often rare for stuff to happen. The weather is also a different story; its very hot in the day the heat rises to around 110 degrees summer time and very refreshing at night around low 80's to mid 60's average. By spending most of my education career here Id say the schools are well planned for children's futures as in having afterschool programs to either help or improve children's grades/struggles along with supervisors if needed, also having encouraging programs such as health/medical care internships, engineering academies, and Advance science trips to give us students many opportunities.",

It’s SUPER dirty and gross and and one of the most run down city I have ever Lived in. This is one of the most miserable cities is California, It’s super hot like Las Vegas during the summer but also if your trying to renovate a home out here or moving in just be sure to be security camera’s and huge locks for your doors so nobody breaks in. The city of Palmdale was ranked the 35th safest city in the world. That is a Joke! Based on FBI crime data, Palmdale is not one of the safest communities in America. ... It isn’t! It is still a majorly boring city because Palmdale CA doesn’t focus on the (27 +) The people who are almost in their 30th’s as in it would be so nice to get a brand new outside mall! I’m so bored of all of these auto malls being built.",

That's when I learned that  there were illegal drugs for sale all around my neighborhood and heroin / Meth users up and down the streets living in their families garages stealing from Walmart and each other to support their habits. These are kids that had been to my home, some that I had coached when they were little. We fled Palmdale when one of my sons friend's died of an overdose. Look at your local stores they have to lock up so many items ; alcohol , razor blades,etc. It's not like that everywhere. The Sheriff knows many of these people but waits to long to act on good information. Demand better from your Cities leadership if  you have to stay!",

          "body": "First the things I love; perfect weather year round means lots of gardening & homes with great floral displays! It is extremely walk and bikeable (unlike San Jose where I used to live). Living in South Salinas and Oldtown areas as an african american senior female, I have always felt safe on my 6:00 am walks. There are always lots of friendly walkers/bikers of all ages thru the day. Some charming neighborhoods. Impromptu sidewalk chatting with strangers or neighbors is common. Great social services (need more tho). Responsive police dept. Local bookstores and coffee shops.  Liberal, active community. Small town attitude but 20 mins away from excitement/nightlife in monterey/Carmel. Open minded folks, little if any overt racism/homophobia.\nThe bad: east/northside gang activity/crime. Very high housing costs. Homelessness/drug use sad & distressing in couple areas. Love Mexican culture/people, but at least 80 to 85% of any one race is not ideal to me. Need more diversity!",

The town is starting to add more things to it like new restaurants and new neighborhoods. There aren't very many entertaining things to do here other than arcades, bowling alleys, movie theaters, and shopping. It gets boring after a while. It's also really expensive to live here. The school district isn't very helpful when it comes to making needed changes or listening to the communities concerns.",

With close access to many major cities in the bay, it is a good distance from the airport with good access to the BART. There are two libraries located on either end of the town and include a great park and proximity access to parks for good outdoors healthy habits if you so choose. \nSchools close by include Pre-k to 12th and various schools to choose from. There are charters, public, and privates all within access of this neighborhood. \nThere have also been many recent projects working on aesthetics and safety. Many murals have been put up, new street lights, and sidewalk implements. With the rise and continuous add-on of new residential buildings, it is clear to see that Hayward is becoming more and more of an established place for families and workers. There is also an increase in supermarkets, and more popping up across the city.",

There’s new development all over the city and the new library downtown is just amazing! The homes on the Hills are breathtaking and luxurious. Want to visit  a lovely Japanese tea garden? check, Farmers Market, check. Hayward has something for everyone. Better buy now before the rest of the Bay Area discovers this hidden - what an under appreciated city.

The real estate market in the Bay is bad in general, but Hayward prices have stayed as constant as they can be (which says a LOT). \nHayward is a vastly developing city, but it's also a city where you can get to know neighbors, of all races too as this city is incredibly diverse (currently #15 Most Diverse City in the nation). \nNo but seriously, you will love it here. Covid has impacted the area as much as any other city, but there are still a wide range of things to do, especially in Downtown. The new library is beautiful and so convenient to residents, with hours from 11-8PM, and 10-5PM, I often lose track of time when I'm in there working on assignments. Hayward's the city that has something for everyone",

I remember the trips to the Corona Public Library with my Dad. There is a diversity of adventures to explore in this one place. This was where I specifically noticed a painting hanging above the checkout area. It was a woman with an orange dress that flowed outward into a circular racetrack. The one painting introduced me to the rich history that we have in Corona. Corona was home to an amazing racetrack along with a thriving citrus industry! Overall, I am proud to be born and raised in an amazing city that offers so much.",

Although there aren't many sources of entertainment in the area nor are the streets completely safe at night, it still has the sense of home that many love and return to. I would want to see the gang violence clean up and I would want to see those kids stuck in bad ways to be helped by their counselors and peers, to be reminded that life is so much more than pride and fighting. However anyone could just sit on the sidelines and complain about how they'd want to see something change yet they don't make that effort. I would be back Corona, back to give back and to help raise our youth through the love of soccer. I would want to create a program and company that's set on raising fine men and women through sports, along with therapists and life coaches along the way to help them find their passions, to find themselves, and to live life, without gang activity nor hate.",

I'd say don't walk the streets alone at night if you want to stay out of trouble but I think you're smart enough to know that already. If you want to go partying with friends and family that's a different story there are all type of clubs, restaurants, and stores owned by a variety of people with different and unique backgrounds. There are many buses if you do not own a car and the traffic is moderate if you do. I went to a Paterson public middle school and I ended up in PCTI, one of the best schools in the state! As long as you work hard you can do whatever you want to accomplish. There is always somewhere you can go to look for work, go online and you can see all available jobs from chef to janitor, take your pick. The cost of living is not too high when compare to our neighbor NY so stop by and pay us a visit.",

Especially if there happens to be a wreck on the interstate during peak hours, but the local Emergency Services can usually get it cleared quickly. Lots of help and community, as this is right beside the university, Middle Tennessee State.",

Although Murfreesboro has many chain businesses, we also host a variety of locally owned stores. Walking through the historic downtown, one can appreciate the building structure and smiling faces. Overall, Murfreesboro is not only a great place to visit but to live!",

However, I really enjoy living here, have bought a house, and intend to stay for the foreseeable future. \nThe city is really reclaiming it's beauty! Downtown is improving with lots of beautiful new lofts, restaurants, and bars. There is a vibrant visual arts community that is growing and expanding constantly with art galleries and studio spaces, and also a historic music scene. We live less than a mile from award winning Amerson River Park where we walk often, and there are LOTS of parks all over the city. \nI have enjoyed the slower pace of a smaller city, being able to get a bigger house and more land for the money, and meeting really great friends and neighbors! \nIt's also located really nicely in the middle of the state, so it's only about 1 hour north to Atlanta, about 2 hours east to the beach, and about 2 hours north to the mountains.",

Macon has seen countless events throughout the years and also has a lot of stories to tell. But looking at the current state of it today, the lovely and beautiful city Macon once was is falling into disrepair. \n\nWhen you walk through downtown, there is a bit of a lifeless vibe that can be observed. Even though there has been efforts to revive downtown economically and socially, little has changed.\n\nThe north side of Macon is nicely developed and enjoys the bliss of economic prosperity. In contrast to the southern side of Macon, called \"Old Macon,\" plagued by gang violence and uncontrolled crimes. In which everyday, shootings happen and people getting killed.\n\nMacon, when looked at from the outside, is a lovely place to live in, if you know where not to look.",

Now I am applying to this scholarship and hoping that i can fulfill my dream, going to college in the US.",

I'm trying to move with my family into a bigger living space and am renting properties.  So far its been a difficult process due to Covid-19 and all of the closings.  My current issue with renting property here in Killeen is dealing with transparency with various realtors.  Im not sure if they are being as transparent as they can be with our application fees.  First, they are non-refundable, which I understand due to it being used for running a background check.  But I have applied so far to three different realtors who have application fees of $45.00  or above and still have not received any confirmation from Equifax, Experian , or Transunion of this transaction.  I receive notifications for everything else I apply for, so why is it now that I am applying for a new space to live, there are no notifications.  This is just observation.  If you know anything please let me know. Thanks!",

Down the street form us recently there was a shooting and the clerk was fatally wounded. Ellison HS from what I hear used to be a great school but it has been 2 weeks in and there was a fire, fighting, and reports of a weapon on campus. The following week there was rumor of a possible school shooting. This area is quickly declining. People always warned me about how awful Killeen is but I never imagined it to be this bad.

It's a mid-size city which provides \"city life\" while not being overwhelming. There are plenty of affordable housing options in and around the city, many from $500-600 a month, and cheaper options can be found with roommates as well. The media gives KC a bad rap with crime, however the majority of the city is extremely safe and I have rarely felt uncomfortable or unsafe in my day-to-day life.",

Most activities/attractions, including fine dining and lodging, are centrally located about 15-30min from anywhere in metro area. AMAZING food, especially if you're a BBQ fan! Non-accredited schools and violence/murder rate are biggest downfalls.",

There are a lot of different areas in Sunnyvale to shop, explore, and have fun. There are still small businesses in Sunnyvale, such as Zanotto's Family Market, the fruit stand, and others around the city. Sunnyvale is a rather big town, but it has that small town feel. You get to know your neighbors and everyone is super friendly. For nightlife, downtown is a great place to go, filled with many restaurant choices, bars, nightclubs, and an ice rink in December. Over the summer, downtown hosts different bands for free concerts on Wednesdays, bringing the community together even more. These are just a few things that make Sunnyvale unique - come visit and see for yourself!",

You can hear some noise from cars. It is very pretty and there are many parks. The bus stations are accesible. However, you may have to walk for quite some time. Nonetheless, it is a 10-20 minute walk. There are small stores that have not branched out. You can try out new food from new restraunts that are small. This is very exciting. There are a variety of hike trails you can access and choose to use. You can pick from the many trails and find ne best or you. I would reccomend hiking in Sunnyvale. Hiking relieves a lot of stress from your body and hiking can relax your mind. Hiking is very fun and you can listen to music. The hike trails could possibly be crowded. Some are. Some aren't. It is up to you to decide. The traffic is average and I feel as if it is better than some places. Overall, Sunnyvale is very fun!",

Truth be told; this city is what I believe to be the perfect example of what the world should be like (It's very close, and it's a process; but Sunnyvale is a place full of diversity and kind people). I feel like with the greater attention towards inclusivity and education; Sunnyvale definitely outshines Cupertino. Every city has it's downfalls; but I believe that watching the overall growth of a city throughout your childhood years, and into you adult years is thought provoking. Out of all the cities in the Bay Area (I've been to a lot); Sunnyvale is the place that shelters the vision of a society that could pave the way to a future without strife.",

Many restaurants, ice cream parlors and places to shop for souvenirs. You can ride bikes or rent them from local bike shops. Many people  jog and exercise on the boardwalk. The many restaurants that line the Boardwalk  have diverse food and music and dancing is very much welcomed.  Hollywood is centrally located. Miami  is to the south with Fort Lauderdale to the north. Hollywood was named one of America's most diverse cities to live in.  Many cultures surround my neighborhood, everyone is very welcoming. With its diversity, comes parties and celebrations of their heritage all year long. Its not surprising to see   fireworks at any given time of the year. Hollywood streets are named after past Presidents, army generals and important American people. At one point I lived on Johnson street, which made me wonder if it was named after Andrew Johnson or Lyndon B Johnson.",

Going to the beach used to be nice, but now parking is too expensive and that is if you find a spot. Not to mention that unfortunately the beaches are polluted. Which is very unfortunate!",

          "body": "Hollywood is an average place. It is somewhat boring and not much happens. It is mainly suburbs, townhomes, and shopping plazas in which publix is the main attraction. Of course we do have the Hard Rock guitar hotel, which I will say is beautiful to look at and oddly comforting to see when you're on the highway and know you're almost home. Hollywood also does have a nice beach area and you can find some life there. One of the main reasons why hollywood is just an average place is that nothing is ever happening. There are no city celebrations (outside of public holidays), no nightlife, and no sense of community (outside of parents involved in their children's school or the many, many churches). There is nothing wrong with that and sometimes too busy places are way worse but if you crave action and a busy nightlife this place does not have it.",

What I hated was the amount of Bay Area xplants coming here and driving the cost of homes up, even out-pricing original residents. Yes, they take their politics with them! Grrr… I also don’t like that there isn’t much land available, and the homes are packed on top of each other, including the gated communities. Traffic is Nuts and the city seems determined to use up every slab of land available. We recently moved north a bit and we have a ton of property, now!  Bay Area xplants may soon have a tax to pay if moving here, due to the irreversible economic & political shift they impose on us. Gone are the days of Roseville being a small train town with a Denio’s flea market.",

There isn't a lot of desperate poverty or extremely affluent households.\nGood place to raise a family, not very much stimulation for adults though one can hike, bike and ski nearby\nThe weather is temperate, especially compared to the East coast and Midwest.\nIt feels like a safe community, though people do tend to be suspicious or distrustful\nYou are in-between beautiful regional areas like San Francisco and Lake Tahoe. CA\nCons:\nThe area is flat, and not wooded like other surrounding areas. The weather can be very hot in the summertime. Today's tempurure was  105 but we are experiencing a heatwave\nRoseville has a suburban urban plan\nNot a lot of culture or nightlife\nThe culture is politically conservative sometimes even reactionary with a fair amount of non-denominational evangelical churches in the area.\nThe area has a flat economy.",

Horrible traffic, high crime rate, poor education system, lack of affordable housing, very poor mass transit. The flooding is bad, especially downtown; cost of living is high. On top of all that, the snobby, elitist attitudes of the people who live and work downtown is hard to stomach. If you look like you are not rich or well-off, you are not treated very well in the shops and restaurants in town. The tourists you visit are, for the most part, completely clueless. They step of the curbs without looking for traffic and then give you the finger for not stopping for them.  My advice-stay away from Charleston!",

Some areas are more safer than others, which should be taken into account if you're looking to live here. There is a nice street called Grand Avenue where nightlife bustles with mom-and-pop restaurants and stores. On Tuesday afternoons, the farmer's market on Grand is open, so you are able to support small and local businesses. Transportation options are limited to buses, as this is a small town, but you can easily transfer to the San Diego Metro station through some routes. Overall, a basic town that's perfect for students or small families!",

I have been able to find a good church where I have connected with some great friends. The aspect of Escondido that could use some attention is the level of homelessness and panhandling. It is sad to see how many people have no safe place to sleep at night. Some areas are sketchy and I avoid them because I do not feel safe there. Overall though, I have enjoyed living here and there is a lot to appreciate about this town! Downtown Escondido has some great little shops and many friendly faces, and Escondido has some nice parks to play in. It may not be perfect, but this is a nice place to live.",

As a kid, I'd participate in several parades a year with the public library. A great thing about Escondido is that it's a whole community. The community of Escondido offers classes of all kind to children and adults. Of course every town has their downfalls and unattractive traits, however when you're involved and trying to better the community, then all the bad is outweighed. Every Friday, April through September, we have Cruise n' Grand, where classic cars all come to Grand and people come and enjoy some kettle popcorn or maybe some dinner, meanwhile listening to live music, and observing these lovely cars. I love Escondido, and couldn't ask for better!",

The residents of Jackson are very welcoming and extremely kind people. Everyone in Jackson supports each other in not only businesses but every day activities. They like to see everyone succeed. I would recommend Jackson to anyone. There is always stuff to do here. There is a very big mall filled with many popular stores  that so many people love. There are many delicious restaurants around there area. Jackson is basically a big circle it does not take more than 20-25 minutes to get from one side of town to the other. The gas is extremely cheap and the cost of living is affordable for everyone. Job opportunity is available all over the city of Jackson, which is very convenient especially for students who not only attend college.",

I love being in close proximity to everything- 15 minutes to Seattle, 15 minutes to wine country, 30 minutes to a beautiful waterfall and snow in Snoqualmie. I also like how diverse it is and traffic is not bad. I appreciate the emphasis on public transportation here and I'm excited for the east side light rail extension. \nBellevue and east side in general is safe and nice looking, but there are a couple cons: eating out is hella expensive. It's not uncommon to end up spending like $25 or more on a whole pizza. Tacos are like $4-5 each at a lot of places. Fish is surprisingly hard to find and is also very expensive unless you want just fish and chips. \nYou can probably find whatever it is you want to eat if you're willing to spend $15-25 for it. That's honestly probably the biggest con.\nOh and the housing market is pretty darn expensive. The rental market isn't bad though.",

There is almost zero night life here and the people are introverted and keep to themselves.   When summer time comes it is so hot you will dread driving to the store. Traffic is heavy and the drivers are rude.  If you are coming here with a high paying job with the intention of raising a family Surprise may be for you.  If you are single and ready to mingle you will be Surprised that your efforts are futile.  This is coming from a tall, attractive, relatively successful man!  Hopefully your luck is better than mine.",

All of the houses/subdivisions look the same and more than not, everyone of them has an HOA that raises its prices yearly. Traffic is ridiculous, electricity with APS is expensive, schools districts are subpar, people are rude, constant car/home burglaries being reported, and dust is everywhere! Our allergies are worse here than during harvest season in the midwest (we were surrounded by corn/bean fields).  The only thing we enjoy is not shoveling snow and being 5-6 hrs from Orange County, California where our immediate family lives.  So, needless to say. Yes its newer, yes its growing, yes summers are scorchers and yes winters are awesome....but for our family, we plan on selling and moving back towards the midwest in the next few years. Surprised, Surprise is not for us!",

Most people are working poor and there are times when families have to sacrifice certain bills. The conditions of Pasadena are okay. They are good enough to motivate young individuals for a better education.",

Some high schools are falling apart structurally, and others seem to not receive enough funding or funding is misused. There isn't a lot of jobs in Pasadena, so an increase in that will be extremely helpful, and nightlife is not very good here neither.",

My first day of school, I had people trying to talk to me! It was crazy. I never experienced that in my past city. Though, I moved here because my parents were able to afford the cheap houses. I have noticed the same atmosphere appear in Pomona as to those middle schoolers reaching out to me. The activities such as beautification, providing schools with chrome books, and emphasizing the power education holds is truly remarkable. I’m proud to say that I will be graduating from a Pomona school in hopes of furthering my education and coming back to empower and motivate the next generation as it did with me!",

Not to mention, it's close to the city for those that really like NYC, but can't afford to live there. If I could, I would clean up the city more from litter. I doubt I myself could lower the crime rates, but it would be nice if they were lower. The attitudes of some residents could be better too, although its also understandable that they've had it rough in life,  so to speak. The taxes of the city, for example, are considerably higher than those of other, cleaner, \"prettier\" and much pricier cities. Public schools don't get as much attention as they could academically, since the students are dismissed as uncaring. Job opportunities are few, probably even more so after the pandemic, and one often has to be willing to commute.",

Public Schools for one deserve more funding, and as someone who works in the public school system here, there is not enough support for staff and that leads to the high turnover rates the city sees.  And it always confuses me that it is this way considering this city has some of the highest property taxes in the state.  Safety is a concern for many, especially in the warmer months.  Nightlife is emerging but not on the level of rapidly growing cities like Stamford or New Haven.  I believe it has the potential to be an amazing city, but the change needs to begin at the top to make things better for the bottom.",

Even though I was raised in a not so perfect neighborhood, everyone there made it feel safe. Violence occurred but never on those who were apart of our community. That is something that definitely needs to change. Everyone should be family and not just those in our specific community.",

Also,  It is loud, polluted here now and it just feels like everywhere you turn it’s so crowded and noisy and sirens and airplanes.  Etc...

There's nice parks in the city to spend time in and you're also not too far from Dallas or lake Lewisville. The construction in Denton seems constant, but the population keeps growing so, I think that's just something we'll have to deal with, but Denton has some nice and quiet neighborhoods, especially to the north.",

The downtown was starting to light up right before COVID but it's been pretty quiet since. The community is really active, there are plenty of resources for help, people are really kind here. There are some crime areas but that's EVERYWHERE. Rockford has a beautiful river area(Sinnissippi), great food, entertainment, and community events. What else can I say about Rockford... its a big small city... meaning at time it can feel like a quant small town but other times its a hustle and bustle city. There are some major projects being done right now to upgrade our downtown area as well as our main roads throughout the community. Rockfordians are very vocal and outgoing, friendly! I work for the county here and absolutely love it!",

I’ve gone through years where I love it and years where I absolutely cannot wait to leave but usually my opinion on Rockford is “eh, it’s alright”. Right now our mayor has implemented a phases of bringing community together and it’s slow going but man are people taking pride in this place and it’s awesome! If I could change something if would be that Rockford would be a safer place to wander about because there’s so many wonderful places to go but people don’t feel safe and therefore don’t go anywhere.",

Small town feel right outside of Dallas. We could definitely use more selections of healthy eating choices and new businesses. The people of the area prefer certain establishments so going too new won’t make it here. You have to go North of Dallas to experience all things pretty and new!  There is somewhat of a push to keep things a certain way by the old timers. When I say old timers, I mean the people who grew up in Mesquite and are still here. The push to make this a growing thriving city tends to be stifled by that group of residents. I see a future for Mesquite but the conservative strong hold has a pretty good grip.  Mesquite is situated between Dallas and other smaller towns. The people of those towns tend to shop and eat in the Mesquite area. The Mall is very popular and have thrived for years!",

The multiple reviews mentioning Mesquite’s stunted growth due to city leadership being hamstrung by a generation of 70 & 80 something-aged seniors is accurate. This selfish “old guard” is losing it’s hold, thankfully. I grew up in Mesquite. I own a 1960’s home there. \nMany neighborhoods in Mesquite are increasingly plagued w/noise disturbances that law enforcement has little ability to effectively address. Frequent, non-permitted home party events w/club grade PA systems pound every weekend. There’s a growing culture of teen, 20/30 something males who blast shocking levels of bass from their vehicles w/clear intent to shake the ground/home foundations/windows of their community, specifically, to block their neighbor’s right of quiet enjoyment to their homes. These are chronic occurrences spanning all hours of day & night.\nDon’t invest here.",

Mesquite is the place that offered solace, a park I’d walk to near the house began what would be a workout regimen. I also decided to return to school as I was healing and enrolled in the local mesquite community college (Eastfield). Best decision I ever made! This city has been my home for a few years after living in Dallas my entire life. The hustle & bustle is a bit less, I’m thankful for the change. The streets need work, that’s my only concern!",

It is cool to hear stories abut Savannah and how things were in the old days. I love that there are still old houses and buildings from the 1700's. That is so neat. When a friend that is not from here asks me about the history of Savannah, i always take joy in sharing the stories and some of the history about this wonderful city. I hope people will continue to respect the historic areas and keep them clean and homeless free in the future. There isn't much to complain about Savannah, besides the ghetto areas and the shootings.

I think it is a nice place to raise a family.  I love, the great out doors. Syracuse is surrounded by beautiful scenery. You can travel a short distance and find yourself being able to hike, ski, bike ride, camp, fish, and any other type of hobbies involving nature. We enjoy four seasons. We also enjoy many different cultures and backgrounds in Syracuse. I would like to see Syracuse  focus more on our infrastructure for example better maintenance our city streets. Id like to see more affordable housing and more focus on lead abatement in older buildings where low income individuals rent. I would like to see more nuisance land lords held accountable for substandard renting practices. I would also  like to see more facilities for individuals with mental health problems and substance abuse problems.",

There’s five high schools and the competition between them is real, but that just makes games more fun! Syracuse University is in Syracuse so going to James street (a street full of food places by the campus) is a fun last time. Destiny USA is also a great place to hangout, and it’s huge. Onondaga lake park is another great place that tends to be avoided because the lake is the most polluted lake in America. The city does have a lot of violence in it and I can frequently hear gunshots, but if you stick to the right crowd, you’ll be fine.",

The public schools are poor, and they are not well funded. Overall a poor city. The people are nice however, depending on who you run into. Destiny USA, the largest shopping mall in NYS is right at your fingertips. Housing is affordable, but minimum wage is average ($11 an hour). Most areas are relatively safe, but some parts are dangerous. The public transportation system is not very convenient and not well organized (such as larger cities like Chicago and NYC). Groceries are overall cheaper than large, high populated cities. You will find housing easily here, although maybe not in the best condition (but bargaining rights! Pay less).",

If you are looking for a place to go out with friends there is 17th Street in Downtown McAllen with an abundance of bars and clubs down that street. If you need some medication that is affordable Mexico is close by. Our city is also about an hour drive from South Padre Island, an awesome beach where the family can go for sun and fun. \n\nThe only thing I do not like is that drivers have become less cautious when it comes to red lights. The light changes and people keep passing through the light.",

Between their Fourth of July festival, winter festival, and more, everyone can attend and have a blast year round. There are parks scattered everywhere and summer events at many. The recent edition of the light rail was a great installation because it means a more green commute to the city for work, baseball games, art festivals and more!",

I'm in my early 20's, learned how to drive here, I know my way around the Denver Metro Area quite well, now living on my own in Northglenn. If you're thinking about relocating to the area there are some things to consider. \nPros: \n-Close to many things:\n     -tons of restaurants (Lazy Dog, Bad Daddy's, Maria's Dulceria)\n     -Lots of activities outdoor & indoor: ax throwing, white water rafting, snow sports, hammocking, smash rooms, paint & sip, aquarium, Meow Wolf\n     -Shopping centers: Orchard Westminster, Denver Premium Outlets, Flatiron Crossing Mall\nCons:\n-Getting extremely overpopulated. Number 1 reason I would consider moving more North up I-25 like Firestone/Erie/Longmont/Loveland. There are tons of accidents & traffic. The cost of living is so high you can't live alone or barely even find decently priced rentals. New builds starting at an average of $500k it seems. Old builds are mostly run down. \nPersonally, I'm moving.",

I have taken swimming lessons at my neighborhood community center, dance lessons and watch amazing fireworks with my family. The community center also hosts events for holidays that are great opportunities to meet up with friends during the day in a safe and well-known location.\n\nMy main complaints are that nearby roads and trains can be loud, the construction from being near Denver can create large amounts of traffic, and some of my neighbors have reported having issues with wildlife. These aren't unexpected issues, and the wildlife problems have decreased over time thanks to the city's response.\n\nOverall, Thornton has been a great place for my family and I to do activities together, get a good education and live in a comfortable environment.",

Fullerton is also well-kept and is low on crime, however I wish the streets were kept in better condition, as some roads have large cracks and can be noisy.

Because it's located very far from any other civilization (every direction) the population consists of the same people day in and day out. Forget about any anonymity you have after a few months you'll be running into everyone you know everywhere you go. No fresh faces anywhere! Finally, this has got to be the least aesthetically pleasing place I've ever lived. Everything is very overgrown and looks run down. Half the town looks like it was abandoned at some point and the forest is taking over. Just driving around anywhere is very ugly as everything looks like it was just randomly slapped there, out of place. Its weird. Also, one of the worst urban planning systems I've ever seen. No backroads or side streets anywhere. Every errand no matter how small throws you in horrible traffic on the main roads. Tolerable as a student but NOT good.",

On one side you'll find people who have lived there their whole lives, they live a simple life, maybe they've been passed down a family farm or a super secret family recipe that the neighbors, who have also lived there for forever, really want to figure out. They tend to frequent all of the classics Gainesville has to offer.  On the other side, you'll find people who love to party in the city, get Krispy Kreme at 3am after a crazy night at the local bar. They tend to frequent all the new trendy places that open up here. There's also the introverts who just like to lounge around at home or read a book under a vine covered laurel oak tree, or in a cafe- maybe they enjoy drinking boba from Teastori while they read. There are two things that the entirety of the town enjoys greatly though. Anybody that I know would absolutely love to come together for a pie at Satchels and/or go out for a game day. Go Gators!",

Gainesville is also a great place to raise a family. I have also found that the community is very proactive with addressing social issues, such as homelessness and health disparities. Since it is a college town, most resources are tailored for students and not for the residents. Things like affordable apartments are harder to find unless they are for students, which is one of the things that I would like to be improved. Public schools are not as great as private schools, however, that is changing as innovative programs are introduced. Mental health has been given more awareness recently, which is great for the community. Gainesville has a lot of professionals who not only grow their careers here, but also donate their time and talent to help others. My overall experience in the Gainesville community has been enriching!",

On the West side, it is presented as the safest part to live in which in general is the case. However, it is not the case from neighborhood to neighborhood. I've lived in Hewitt and Woodway which are cities on the outskirts of Waco and they are safe neighborhoods. Police are very present and responsive. I've also lived not too far from there. I've also lived about 5-10 mins drive away from those outskirt cities and crime and safety are a stark difference. In the Richland Hills neighborhood, I had to deal with shootings being a weekly or monthly occurrence. I've caught shocking things on my security cameras! Drug-related incidents such as witnessing people using drugs out in the open is a possibility in the apartment complexes in Richland Hills. If you move to Waco, I strongly recommend researching the the neighborhood of places you're looking to move into!",

You have a wide variety of restaurant choices here too: barbecue, Tex-Mex, and Asian are a few of them. Of all the things I like about Waco, my personal favorite is Cameron Park, where I hike on black diamond and double black diamond trails! It is a fairly clean city that is full of housing choices, public school choices, and transportation choices. Waco has beautiful springtimes, cool autumn, and mild winters. Summer is HOT, which means lots of swimming, movies in air conditioning, and ice cream! Walks along Lake Brazos and other outdoor activities keep you busy, as well as travel to other Texas cities like Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio. It's a great city!",

Although it  is a bigger city, it is not the safest. Safer communities are those on the outskirts of town, like Woodway and Beverly Hills. There is minimal retail shopping also, so residents or locals might want to travel to Austin or up to Dallas-Fort Worth. There are very excellent restaurants in Waco, like Ninfas, Hecho En Waco, Chuys Woodway, and Diamond Back Steakhouse. Also, the schools are average. But overall, a good town with good character.",

The places that surround us are packed with high sodium and saturated fat options, and it can be difficult to navigate a menu to find a healthy option.",

It has been growing a lot in the past few years and its becoming a very nice place. I loved West Valley City because it's so diverse! I had great friends growing up and enjoyed it. There are some neighborhoods that are a little scary and I wouldn't be out there alone at night, but there are also very nice neighborhoods that are much safer.",

Still my neighborhood was clean and the homes were taken care of. Some young professionals while other lower working class. Warren has such potential, but with a prejudice mayor, police chief and many residence Warren will Never thrive. Warren needs more Starbucks a Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s, make Hoover and Van Dyke hubs for shops and gastro-pub dining similar to Royal Oak and Ferndale then Warren would be awesome. Unfortunately that will never happen. So I’ll be moving from here shortly, my home going to a young Korean family..... I know my neighbors will HATE that.",

The people, culture, history, and overall the area just has multiple vacant shopping districts, but no one takes the opportunity to use those buildings to create local and generational wealth. There isn't currently much to do, but with the proper direction and funding, Hampton, Virginia can become a key tourist area in the next thirty to fifty years. \n\nWith proper local funding for new establishments, entertainment centers, and reasons to shop in the area, we can improve roads, the education system, pay, and life as a whole for the future generations. I truly love my city and the opportunities it has given me with sports, connections, relationships, and memories. I just want others to see what I see in the area that we live in. It is also the reason why I want to pursue Law to try and help the area grow in hopes that low income families prosper in the future.",

I am not satisfied with their school system and how they deal with children with mental health disorders in the school. They are not equipped to help those children in my opinion and have had issues with them assisting my family because I have two grandchildren in school that have mental health disorders and the school has not helped us much and I just don't understand what the issue is is and how they are not equipped to help and deal with this issue since it is becoming more problematic in schools here in Hampton. When Covid19 hit is was hard to even get people to come out to your home when a child was in crisis and calling the crisis intervention people only made things worse and they would refer you to call the police but they are crisis intervention specialists. That was something else as myself being a Mental Health Counselor I could not understand the logic behind that, what about those children in need.",

Dayton is a unique place where you can find diversity.  It has feel of being a small community, but when you look at the city and surrounding suburbs, you realize it is quite large. It's one of those places where it is likely that many of your friends are connected. Because of the low cost of living, it is a good place to buy a home a raise a family. There are available jobs and opportunities to start businesses as well. On the other hand, it is a bit transient and you find folks leaving for bigger cities and opportunities. Because of the manufacturing jobs that left decades ago, downtown Dayton is still feeling the affects. You can tell when you drive through and see the abandon buildings. After the recent tornado and shooting in the Oregon district, it has been tough. However, we are \"Dayton Strong\".  We can rally together and get through this!",

The rivers downtown on the walk are accentuated by a minor league baseball park and dog park (Deed's Point). Suburbs like Kettering and Centerville offer some food classics (Bill's Donuts, Dorothy Lane Market, Cassano's, Hot Head Burritos, Marion's Piazza*). In January, Kettering hosts the Flyin' To The Hoop – Basketball Invitational which has attracted talents like the Ball brothers in the past. A lot of players are already committed to top programs.

The nightlife can be overrun by USC students but it does not take away from a night out. Main street is in the process of being revitalized and it is only adding to the value of living here. You can't beat being two hours from \"anywhere\" - mountains, beach, or city life - in Columbia, you can have it all!",

There are liberal enclaves, but in general it's a pretty conservative place.",

At the end of 5th grade the city of Cedar Rapids was hit with a flood that took out a section of the community, which my family and I were effect by, causing many people to lose their homes. Another experience that effected the whole city and surrounding areas was a derecho, which caused damages to people roofs and property in general. Besides natural disasters, my experience has been pleasant. Many parts of the city have parks, places to eat, and places to enjoy entertainment. A district that goes by the name of \"NewBo\" has recently risen in the downtown area after the catastrophic flood in 2008, this area began to rebuild and is a nice area for visitors and people of the area to enjoy their experience of Cedar Rapids that also portrays a historical culture and background of the city's origins.",

It's safe, white, and the average suburban neighborhood.  \n\nIt's relatively safe as I stated I lived in the suburban middle class sections--but it doesn't take long to reach the shady parts of the neighborhood, my uncle lived about five minutes away and his house was broken into by middle schoolers, so, take that as you will. There's also alot of job opportunities here! Quacker Oats is a huge business for us--so if you like engineering this is the place for you!",

You can \"Go Cart\", Ice skate, and many other activities as well as hanging out with friends in downtown Stamford. Not only that but many public parks that you can bike, walk, picnic, play sports like basketball, swim, and even barbeque.Some of those places are Scalzi park, cove park with there beaches. As well as lone park. Other notable parks include, mill river park which is a great place for sight seeing and walking around, also Kosciusko park, cummings park and more! Stamford athletically is good because of the sports complex's like  sports complexes, like Bobby Vs, also Chelsie piers that also has fields and courts but younger kids can swim there and gymnastics and trampolines. Not only is Stamford exiting but the restaurant choices might be the best in CT. fancy restaurants, diners,  great places for Icecream",

You can see the diversity through art festivals, farmer's markets, as well as entertainment such as community theater and sports teams. My favorite landmark is the Museum & Nature center which features a farm, reptile house, playground, and museum. I love to hike through the trees there, especially during autumn when the leaves are fiery oranges and yellows. My favorite event in Stamford is the Thanksgiving Day parade. Families gather on the streets to watch giant helium balloons pass by apartments, listen to bagpipe players, dance together and eat lots from local eateries. I think Stamford would be a fantastic city for a wide range of people, from a college student to someone that wants to settle a family. It has a growing population with many opportunities for jobs, education, entertainment, and leisure!",

It's a great city for young individuals who are recent graduates and those who are commuting to New York City. The train station to Grand Central is right there surround by an abundance of restaurants and stores.\n\nOne downfall is that the public school system isn't anything special compared to the neighboring towns. From what I've heard, the public schools are pretty average, but if a parent wants their child in an academically rigorous, competitive school, some families choose to put their children in local private schools.",

Crime flourishes here and there are allot of low income and rental housing areas. Business development never took off due in part to the poor planning of the City of Victorville and the inabilities of the area to attract viable commercial enterprises. I do not recommend this area. Yes housing is affordable however the reason is due to the things I have stated. If you must live in this area your better off looking at it’s sister city Apple Valley where there are some improved conditions. One note, Apple Valley has some bad areas too (Felony flats) so be aware of the High Desert as a whole and know which neighborhoods are OK and which are definitely not advisable.",

Even though the city is expanding greatly by adding new and bigger companies to fairly more modern parts of town, thus creating more job opportunities, it seems like \"Old Town Victorville\" is being neglected more and more as many of the buildings are becoming increasingly outdated and the area is known to have a homeless and crime problem.  Thankfully, schools are something that is financially invested in heavily but many schools still fail to have good staff at the helm depending on the school.  It is a decent and affordable location for people looking for a place to stay but I can't see this location as a very high candidate for raising a family.",

It's advised that children should be careful when playing outside. Sometimes, children will play harmless pranks on the neighbors and try to disturb everyone in the surrounding area. There's not much to do in Victorville, but there are a few nice parks around the area. Unfortunately, troublemakers tend to hang around these parks, but if there are a lot of children and their parents hanging out at the park, then you're safe. The Victor Valley mall is also a decent area to hang out with your friends and it's a nice area for a date. The schools in Victorville are pretty good because everyone comes from diverse backgrounds and seems to get along with each other, but they're nothing special. Houses up here are pretty affordable and there are some nice retirement homes very close to Victorville.",

People can shop at The Mills at Jersey Gardens and Broad Street. The city is effective at involving the community with elections, school board meeting and an Instagram account. Often, the mayor attends performances at the arts high school! There was also recently a city-wide initiative that planted trees for people's yards for free.\nThe city is not without fault, however. It is not known for its safety and Elizabeth is populated to the point of crowding. There are a lot of people who live in poverty or without shelter or food. Outside of walking to and from school or occasionally a corner store, most teens and people overall choose cars over a cleaner transportation system, though the buses are utilized greatly. Lime scooters have also been introduced to Elizabeth as of autumn of 2019, so that may have a large impact on how we travel.",

A place where i always felt safe, comfortable, and at home. A place where diversity thrives and cultures boom. A place where everyone can belong. That's Elizabeth, NJ. Elizabeth is a beautiful city full with many opportunities. A great city to get a good start in life. I had been living in Elizabeth for almost five years if I am not wrong. Is good to live in Elizabeth NJ, is a very diverse place and the people are friendly. What I like about Elizabeth NJ is that you can find jobs near where you reside most of the time. Also, I like that you have everything near you, food fast, supermarkets, hospitals, police stations, etc. One thing that I would change is the security of the city in general and decrease the crime.",

The cost of living was also getting out of control! I remember my grandparents living on Inslie Ave for decades but they eventually moved to Elmora! My grandfather was well know down the port he bartended at Als 316 club and the bar Cady corner to it (I forget the name (it's a apartment building now! He was also the elevator operator at the old Singer plant a security guard he was jumped in the 80s by a group of hoodlums! Was lucky to survive it was a low blow he was old school from Brooklyn when people fought one on one, he was a golden gloves champion they would have lost if it was a fair fight! I remember Chicks seafood and the Belum lounge. Before all the changes.",

I have been schools all across New Haven; from private, magnet, charter, and public( for the last two years of high school).While living in this city I have taken every opportunity that they offered. I have apart of youth groups, pathfinders, HPREP ( Programs ran by Yale University), volunteering at Yale New Haven Health, and many more. Some deem New Haven has a \"terrible\" city but that is not the case. Yes, there are issues that need to fixed regarding safety but overall you can definitely raise a family, and have them succeed. As far as \"Healthy Living\" goes New Haven is great with that because we have farmers markets, vegan restaurants, and a lot of plant based places as well. Lastly, if you are looking for diverse community to be around then New Haven is the place to be.",

There are caribbeans, spanish cubans, haitians, italians, etc. There are two distinct areas of Miramar in my opinion. There is the east side and the west side. The west side is more affluent with targets and starbucks galore and the east side is more your mom and pop shops. I love the wide freeways that are normal to most of eastern Florida. I generally felt safe here. I loved the proximity to Miami proper. The bus system is pretty accessible and goes MANY places, however the city is not really walkable at all. It gets super hot but you probably already know that. There are a lot of events going on here and a sense of community.",

The city is very family oriented and safe. The city has been growing yearly, as it has been attracting more residents into the area and you can see many multiple construction sites taking place and the city continues to develop with high end shopping plazas, grocery stores and restaurants. The growth and development that has been taken place here is amazing. Most neighborhoods throughout the area are gated communities that are well manicured with amazing lake views.

It’s awesome to be just half an hour from downtown Seattle and Bellevue (made it back from Amazon hq in 24min the other day)!",

Plus, the air quality is great! \n\nThe food around here is also amazing--there are cuisines from around the world all in one spot. There's nothing here that you can't find. From American to Thai to India to Filipino, there are simply so many options that it might get hard to choose. \n\nAdditionally, the education system is great in Kent; there are plenty of top-notch primary and secondary schools that will well prepare any student for life outside of school.",

However, crime is high, and rent increases, making it harder for low-income families to reside. I think kent needs more security and safety for the residents that already call Kent home. If individuals can afford the rent and hiking cost home sales, then the suburbs of Kent may be the safest neighborhood outside of the downtown and metropolitan areas. I live in Kent in the valley neighborhood, and I feel safe in the apartment complex I live in; however, I've lived in Kent for over six years. I have definitely seen the changes of the community become occupied by homeless individuals and suffering from mental illness. This is why I've decided to pursue Social Work, so I can find out how I can best support communities in great need and help bring much-needed resources to disproportionately marginalized communities and under-served.",

What I like about Sterling Heights is the diversity and the average prices of products (not too expensive but not very cheap either). There are many clean and nice apartments to rent or buy in this city. I have lived in this city for almost 4 years now and I never had a problem with our neighbors! Most people here are respectful. It's a quiet area and there are many stores around, specially grocery stores. There are many restaurants and cultural restaurants in and around the area, which makes it a really fun are to live in. But I wish the roads will get fixed and become better. Also, I hope they start working more on improving their public schools.",

It’s going the way of Warren and other working class suburbs in decline. To be blunt, my neighbors are low class, inconsiderate, and ignorant. Lots of renters moving into the apartment and condo complexes in the southern part of the city. There is a large Chaldean population here, more of the working to middle class variety. The wealthier ones are moving to more norther suburbs in Macomb County. The further north you go in Sterling Heights you’ll find more restaurants, shopping, and nice parks. Sterling Heights was not a good fit for me and I would not move here again.",

When driving, you can pass by Korean, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and even Mexican restaurants and stores within a matter of minutes! This diversity makes for a community full of open-minded residents and children. In addition, Carrollton is conveniently located near Addison, Farmers Branch, Plano, and Lewisville!\n\nNext, Carrollton is overall a very afforable area. Of course, there are some expensive clusters of homes here and there, but the cost of living in Carrollton is very low. \n\nWhile I may love Carrollton, one thing I would like to note is that Carrollton is quite old. This means that some of its schools are on the older side, and they may have outdated facilities or resources. In addition, many of Carrollton's homes are on the older side, so I wouldn't recommend Carrollton to younger people hoping to live in modern apartments or homes.",

While Farmers Branch ISD is not great, Lewisville  ISD has some of the best elementary, middle, and high schools available in the state of Texas. The population of the city is diverse, and there are amazing community centers such as the Rosemeade Recreation Center. When the housing market is mid range, homes are affordable for the average middle class family. Speaking of family, there is always something to do with the whole gang, and it is always safe to spend a night on the town. The highlight of the city is in fact downtown. There are many shops, a brewery that hosts weekly bingo, and the downtown area hosts many festivals throughout the year. Carrollton is an amazing city for amazing people.",

On top of the fact that the community is extremely united and diverse, there's also many places to visit. Every Sunday, for instance, there is a local farmers' market. In other words, if you're looking for freshly grown/healthy products, Coral Springs is the place for you! The schooling may be called \"flawed\" by others, but in all honesty, I personally have never had a problem. Though there has been issues in the past, people tend to overlook the tremendous improvements that have been made. The bus process is extremely efficient in Coral Springs, allowing everyone a smooth and quick transport. Ultimately, not only is Coral Springs a place, it's also my home.

Midland is a great place for young people looking to find high paying jobs that have opportunities to promote quickly. It is hard for restaurants, grocery stores, & other retail businesses to stay staffed as many people work in the oilfield leaving these types of jobs unfilled. You can move here, work a lot of hours, gain tons of experience including management experience & save money. When you get ready to retire you have plenty saved and if you buy real estate you can sell it & have even more to help you live a great retirement. My husband is currently a restaurant mgr & I work as a hostess & am attending school to complete my BA in Technical Mngmnt with a major in Human Resources. We have purchased a beautiful home here & plan to use our equity as part of our retirement. If you believe in working hard & are looking for great opportunities then Midland is the place to move!",

It is a very involved community and there are great organizations here like: the Boys and Girls club, the YMCA, and Casa de Amigos, all of these wonderful non-profit organizations are what help the community stand out to others around them. Yes, before I did say that there were hardly things to do around her does not mean there is nothing to do, the fair comes around, going to the sporting events, like volleyball, soccer and lacrosse are what make coming to Midland so fun! It is so exciting to see young people work so hard in and out of school. One of the great things about Midland is how they strive to have a cleaner communtiy, like: Keep Midland Beautiful, but they do not just care about MIdland but there entire state: Don't mess with Texas, it is such a refreshing atomsphere.",

There are beautiful, well-maintained parks in Midland. The schools in Midland are awesome for my children. It’s not cheap to live here but you make lots of money with all these opportunities. I work here in the oil field with my family. Crime is pretty low and neighborhoods are quiet. The only bad thing that i could see there is traffic. Traffic is not as bad as in DFW where i used to live. I am glad to be here as a resident of Midland. I love it here and i’m sure that you will love it too. The homes are well-constructed and it’s easy to get a home here. The nightlife here is great.",

The school has a great walking pathway system that leads you all over and if you have the time visit the Sarkeys Energy Center for any Enviornmental/Oil and Gas/Geographic or Geological research, the building even has a ton of fossils and minerals to observe while on tour!",

It also has a variety of restaurants and cafes, something for basically every person. Norman is a pretty safe place. I have not had any issues while living in this suburb. I think it is a great place to raise a family and to attend school. Above all, I highly recommend Norman!",

The schools have been great so far. The teachers and administrators are highly qualified; amazing parental involvement, and a diverse student body. Past trends have been to live in surrounding counties for the \"better schools\" but there seems to be more investment in our schools with the county and parents choosing to stay in Athens.

Santa clara electric system is separate from PG&E, making prices cheaper. Water is included in rent.  The areas to rent are pet inclusive allowing for people to be with loved ones and having understanding neighbors. There's always a good location to dine in or to even have drinks. Public school systems have pretty well maintained fields and have alot of opportunities.  Real estate is expensive however for living costs. Renting is more affordable. Jobs are available and competitive.",

Santa Clara has a surprisingly provincial compared to neighbor Sunnyvale which feels busier, or Mountain View which is, like Palo Alto, rather more elitist. Santa Clara is just... friendly in comparison. Bland initially, it has improved over the years with more trees and better retail. Climate is perfect. Gets a bit polluted during winter, like the rest of the bay area. Cupertino schools are truly top notch. Feel exceedingly safe. Excellent city services. Houses go for 1.5M+ in my neighborhood, but very little inventory year over year. Traffic is the main neighborhood concern due to Apple commuters. However residential streets are not really affected just avenues. Love to walk and run daily through all local streets. Busier Palo Alto feels too urban and busy for that. Overall we feel very blessed and fortunate to have landed in southwest Santa Clara!",

The El Camino Real has choices of culinary cuisine to satisfy your palette with various shops for all your needs. \n\nThe school system is just that. Any child can succeed here with both support from home and school with average-sized classrooms.\n\nIt's a diverse city just like the Bay Area in general. Everything you need is here, you don't really need to venture out passed the city limits, and if you do you won't need to go far. \n\nAny other time there is plenty to do with city events, Farmers Market, Wine Festivals dancing in the streets. As you know during this modern-day plague things are limited and for good reason. \n\nPricey to live here? You get what you pay for. I decided to move my family here more than 20yrs ago because I wanted our son to grow up in a decent city neighborhood/area, no gangs, no graffiti in our area. I can rest easy at night knowing my family is safe, worth every penny.",

Downtown is nice and is a very artsy place if you like that sort of thing. The restaurants around town are very good as well, some of my favorite things in Fargo are the west acres mall and Marcus theaters. Gas prices could be worse so not much to complain about there, and to kill time I always find myself roaming the aisles of Mills fleet farm or the local Menards as there is always something new to me there. The town is a very dog friendly town and I feel very comfortable taking my pooch on a daily walk around my nice neighborhood. Since living here my family hasn’t been the victims of any property crime or violence and the schools are very student orientated. Should you visit Fargo? I think so, But bring a jacket!",

It is a flat land, with no activities or attractions. There is wonderful opportunity here, and i definitely see this place growing into more of what I was hopping it would be within the next decade. Personally, I never want to live here again because there isn't much to do here. Most people, not from the midwest, don't even know this place exists. Personally, I'm not a fan of that.

In addition to sports, the arts are well supported too. It was quite an honor to have the Pride of Pearland, the Pearland High School’s marching band in the 2020 Rose Parade. It was a team effort to take such a large group on such an amazing trip. For months various businesses hosted “spirit nights” donating a portion of the proceeds to the trip.
