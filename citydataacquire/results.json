New York is celebrated for its wealth of nationalities, ethnicities and languages. But why would anyone want to live in NYC? It's insanely expensive, there are too many crazy people, it's bundles of energy and famously, \"If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere.\" And lots of people love the challenge! Most important, it’s the city that exemplifies American pluralism, the “melting pot” that attracts new immigrants looking for work and college graduates drawn from their hometowns by the promise of excitement and opportunity. Its appeal hangs on its image as a city where everyone can try, get, and be anything. It has been my home for more than 40 years and I love it for its social and economic freedoms. My education and computer technology background fit right in and I found great career and social successes.",

If you're an on the go kind of person, the city is the place for you! However, there are definitely downfalls about living there. For one, everything is HARDER living in such an urban environment. Getting places, grocery shopping, regular household stuff such as doing laundry (if you're building doesn't have a laundry machine), maintenance issues, etc. It's also crazy expensive. But honestly, where I'm at in my life right now, I wouldn't trade living there for the world.",

What I definitely like about this city is the amount of opportunities and lack of scarcity of anything. There is almost an abundance of everything you can imagine! As I grew older I began to relize that the main thing I do not like or appreciate about this city, is the cost of living. This ties into businesses, businesses owners, company executives, because a lot of the higher ranked individuals who want to make more money, make it harder each year for individuals like myself who try to make way for themseleves for a better life. I see a lot of people using other people to their advantages in order to gain some benefit from one another. I do not like the fact that it is such a steep and treacherous uphill battle for individuals who were not born with a lot and who have to really battle for their path of life.

If I could change any one thing about LA, it would be the addition of viable and comprehensive public transit - it really pales in comparison to other cities of a similar size, like New York City or London. Another thing to consider is the weather. Most people love LA for its mild climate. Personally, I'm a fan of changing weather and seasons - having grown up in the midwest, it's something that I really miss about home. So if you like a variety from day to day (and also like to wear a variety of outfits), then Los Angeles may not be the place for you. However, even for someone like me who really hates the never-changing weather, there are still so many opportunities here - from jobs to recreation - that the cons are widely outshone by the pros.",

You can find any ethnic town you could think of; from Chinatown to Olvera street, Thai Town and Little Armenia, you will be encompassed by the culture and don't even get me started on the amazing authentic food! Nothing beats the diversity that comes with Los Angeles. Aside from this there is so much opportunity here. Born and raised in Sacramento, I didn't know how interesting life could really be. Dreams do come true in Los Angeles as long as you have the right attitude. As with everything else though, there are some major problems here. The homeless community in LA is the hardest part. Skid Row is notoriously known for it's homeless community, the area's hardship's date back to the 1880's. If I could help to change one thing about LA, it would be this.",

Sometimes, it's hard to see both the wealth of certain people and the dying one in the street. As an International student, it's hard to cope with such a gap. I was told it was inevitable to have a car in LA, I personally think it's not true. I've been using public transportation since I've arrived and I'm pretty much satisfied with it!

There are hundreds of things to do. For example, if you want to do touristy activities, you can go to the bean, Grant Park, John Hancock Center, and Navy Pier. However, if you want a more local experience, you can go to Millennium Park and watch a movie outdoors with the rest of the city, go to Chinatown and explore different Chinese dishes, visit Little Village and get an authentic Mexican American experience. People tend to be generally kind and respectful to one another. The city is among one of the cleanest in the United States! We have one of the best public transportation systems and one of the largest public school systems in the United States. Additionally, there are four distinct seasons that each offer unique experiences.",

Incredibly diverse with rich culture in every neighborhood, the windy city has something to offer everyone. As a queer person, I feel incredibly safe here and am surrounded by community. The CTA, our public transit system, and the city's bike-friendliness have allowed me to happily, easily live here without a car. The winter's are tough, but the summers are worth it!",

My experience with Chicago has been both good and bad. There is a lot of violence and injustice that comes with living here. I love the beautiful view and skyline. I love The Bean and Navy Pier. Chicago is indeed ready for a change. I feel as though everyone as a whole and community should come together to support each other and have a positive attitude.You can go to the lakefront. Chicago has Lake Michigan with it’s numerous beaches and parks. Chicago is unique and diverse. Chicago food is a must! Chicago is known for some of the best restaurants. The pizza is thick, the hot dogs are unmatched, and there's this food called Italian beef. Chicago has multiple places you can visit and cite see.  Overall, Chicago is indeed a loving place. We just have to progress and work towards change in some aspects. -Thank you!",
